			<p id="name">UNDER CONSTRUCTION WEB SITE,
			  All links now work.  However, the web site is still
			  under construction, since while building it, I
			  learned how better to design it going forward.
			  Future Plans are to shorten web pages if they are 
			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do
			  that too.</p>

		  <br><h4>Python Class Example: Breadth First Search Search, Depth First Search: Exercises in tree data
			search efficiency and optimization in Python </h4><br>

		  <p><em><strong>Python Class Example that follows the above
		  example is provided in the same code link below: Puzzles
		  with BFS and DFS, Max Clique Subgraphs and Power Sets:
		  Exercises in tree data search efficiency and optimization in
		  Python</strong></em></p>

		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/Python_GraphPuzzle_Clique_WeightedEdgesNodes_PowerGraphs_MaxCliq_BreadthFirstSearch_DepthFirstSearch">Links
		    to Python Class Example: Breadth First Search Search,
		    Depth First Search, Puzzles, Max Clique Subgraphs, Tree 
		    and Graph Algorithms, and Power Sets : Exercises in tree 
		    data search efficiency and optmization in Python. We 
		    explored graphs to find paths that represent physical 
		    networks.  They are used for communication networks, 
		    circuits, genes, social networks, disease populations, 
		    etc.</a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>Comparing the Breadth First Search, Depth First
		      Search, in a class example</li><br>
		    <li>Some rules to set up the example and terminology that follows.</li><br>
		    <li>A graph: set of nodes connected by edges.</li><br>
		    <li>Edges: unidirectional if directed, or a digraph.</li><br>
		    <li>If weight or cost added to an edge, then it is a
		      weighted graph.</li><br>
		    <li>Graph optimizations: shortest path (SP): shortest set
		      of edges from node A to B</li><br>
		    <li>Shortest weighted path: same as SP but with a minimum
		      function on weights of edges</li><br>
		    <li>in sequence cliques - set of nodes such that there is
		      a path with maximum length in graph between each pair of
		      nodes in set</li><br>
		    <li>Minimum Cut: 2 sets of nodes, a cut is a set of edges
		      whose removal eliminates all paths from every node in
		      one set to each node in the other.  The minimum cut is
		      the smallest set of cuts.</li><br>
		    <li>DFS (Depth First Search) starts at root and if not
		      goal node, you extend the current path by adding each
		      child of current node to path, unless already in
		      path.</li><br>
		    <li>New paths added to set of paths at front (a stack -
		      last in, first out).</li><br>
		    <li>Select next path: recursively repeat.  If no children, 
		      go to next node, and stop when goal node is reached or
		      there are no more paths.</li><br>
		    <li>SP: track best path found so far: when you find a new
		      path, keep going if path still shorter than
		      best.</li><br>
		    <li>BFS (Breadth First First): do not go down first branch
		      of existing tree.  Instead, examine all children of
		      current node first before going deeper in tree.</li><br>
		    <li>BFS, no weights, stop when you find solution,
		      guaranteed SP.</li><br>
		    <li>BFS starts at root node, and if not goal, extends
		      current path unless child already in path.</li><br>
		    <li>Add new paths to potential set of paths: put at end of
		      set (uses a queue - First In, First Out, push to end,
		      pop at front).</li><br>
		    <li>Select next path and recursively repeat.  If no
		      children, go to next, and stop at goal node or when no
		      more paths.</li><br>
		    <li>Things we observed from this example:</li><br>
		    <li>Weighted graphs: DFS can sum weights rather than just 
		      check length of path.</li><br>
		    <li>BFS: 1st found solution may not be best.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <br><h4>Python Class Example: Puzzles with BFS and DFS, Max
		    Clique Subgraphs and Power Sets: Exercises in tree data
			search efficiency and optimization in Python </h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>We explored graphs to find paths that represent
		      physical networks.</li><br>
		    <li>We used graphs to search and explore changes to the
		    state of a physical system, with nodes representing states
		    of the system, edges the actions that cause the change of
		    state, and found a sequence of actions to convert the
		    system to the desired state.</li><br>
		    <li>We did an 8-puzzle example and kept track of legal
		      shifts in a dictionary (graph edges), and the puzzle
		      used BFS and DFS, checking for loops.  BFS was quicker 
		      for this, with DFS taking a long time and running out of 
		      memory.</li><br>
		    <li>We then explored Max Cliques: making subgraphs, such
		      as all people connected to each other in social network, 
		      infected populations that had contact, and you make 
		      collections of cliques.</li><br>
		    <li>They are used for communication networks, circuits,
		      genes, social networks, disease populations,
		      etc.</li><br>
		    <li>The max clique can use brute force for small problems,
		    and find all subgraphs, test if complete (all connected), 
		      keep track of largest clique, and extend to recursively 
		      find other large cliques by removing nodes of largest 
		      cliques and repeating.</li><br>
		    <li>The last example was a power set, the set of all
		      subsets.</li><br>
		    <li>To find cliques, generate power sets, all subgraphs, 
		      test if all connected and complete, and keep track of 
		      largest found.</li><br>
