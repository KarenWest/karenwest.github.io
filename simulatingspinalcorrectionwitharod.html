		  <br><h4>Description of Brainstorm idea NOT followed, to
		  simulate spinal correction with a rod</h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>I once asked a professor the worth of doing something
		      in the biomedical space, way back when I was 23 or 24
		      years old, and when this class took place, I was 50 years
		      old, so it was quite a long time ago!  I asked if you
		      could <strong>simulate</strong> a biomechanical
		      procedure on a human body before actually doing the 
		      procedure, so as to avoid things like paralyzing the 
		      person by doing it.  I said
		      they simulate many things out there in software, such as
		      hardware design and mechanical designs, so why cant you do
		      it to a human body?  I was naive of course, and here is
		      why it makes no sense.</li><br>
		    <li>The reason this idea made no sense was for 2 major
		      reasons.  The first was at the time, there would be no
		      large market need for such a risky project idea and no one
		      would ever be interested in funding its exploration.  The
		      second reason, is because simulating the human nervous
		      system and other parts of their anatomy was nearly
		      impossible, and you would need to do that with the
		      biomechanical correction in order to truly do it in
		      software before trying it on a person.  So I am sure this 
		      professor had a good laugh when I asked this after
		      class!</li><br>
