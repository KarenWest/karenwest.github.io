		  <br><h4>Python Project: Solution Search applied to Pacman
		  game: </h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>We implemented breadth first search (BFS) using a FIFO data 
		      structure to explore graph paths, depth first search (DFS)
		      using a stack data structure for exploring graph paths, 
		      uniform cost search and a star search, using priority 
		      queues to explore graph paths and had to compare the
		      results.</li><br>
		    <li>We ran the algorithms on different sized mazes for
			Pacman to explore and made cost comparisons.</li><br>
		    <li>With a varying cost function, Pacman may choose
		      different paths.</li><br>
		    <li>We explored charging more for for more dangerous steps 
		      in a ghost-ridden environment and charging less in 
		      food rich areas.</li><br>
		    <li>A rational Pacman agent would adjust his behavior in
		    response to the cost comparison of the path
		    taken.</li><br>
		    <li>Each search algorithm is similar except in how they
		      manage the fringe of path exploration (data structures 
		      mentioned above).</li><br>
		    <li>BFS expands outward in every direction, but is
		    not sensitive to exploration cost.</li><br>
		    <li>Uniform Cost Search is similar to BFS except that it 
		      gets farther in the lower cost area than BFS in getting 
		      to the goal node.</li><br>
		    <li>It is not as good as A-star search, because it
		      explores every direction and has no information about 
		      the goal.</li><br>  
		    <li>It starts at the top and works systematically down,
		      finding the cheapest path in terms of cost.</li><br>
		    <li>DFS goes to the highest depth before going further in 
		      the search.</li><br>
		    <li>We did not do greedy search, but that goes straight to 
		      the solution node and is not optimal, since it goes
		      through high cost areas to get to the goal.</li><br>
		    <li>A-star hedges its bets, explores a bit in the wrong 
		      direction, just to be sure because the heuristic it uses 
		      is imperfect, but it does a very small amount of work,
		      not much worse than greedy, and it is optimal.</li><br>
		    <li>A-star uses backward costs and estimates of forward
		      costs.  It is optimal with admissible and
		    consistent heuristics.  Heuristic design is the
		    key to it, and sometimes it makes sense to use a relaxed
		    problem, and is what to use in practice.</li><br>
