		  <h4>Very Basic C Shell Linux Command Line Interpreter</h4>
		  <ul>
		    <li>a basic multi-process C shell Linux command interpreter</li>
		    <li>in the future, it may be expanded to take a traveling
		    salesman threads, with a sorter of their paths</li>

		    <li>goals of implementation were to become more familiar with the primitives used in process control and inter-process communication</li>

		    <li>future goals may be to simulate a multi-threaded
		    environment that implements inter-process communication,
		    signal handling, and a stronger understanding of flow
		    control</li>
		    </ul>
		    <h4>Two primary aspects of this project:</h4>
		    <ul>
		      <li>implementing a shell environment to process command
			line input specification and execution of a parallel 
			program that is either comprised of multiple processes 
			or threads</li>

		      <li>Concepts Used to complete this project included: 
			inter-process communication, (including pipes, signals
			, shared memory), process creation and execution.</li>
			
		      <li>Relevant functions include: 
			getcontext, makecontext, setcontext, swapcontext, 
			sigsetjump, siglongjump, kill, pipe, popen, shmget, 
			shmctl, shmat, fork, execve, execvp, etc.</li>
		    </ul>
		    <h4>Four Programs Involved</h4>
		      <p>Only the first very basic version of the shell is done and the rest are future work:</p> 
		      <ul>
			<li>Basic shell (done in C) for specifying and
			executing programs, called "myshell" .</li>

			<li>Goal: to implement a basic shell called "myshell", 
			  to learn how a command interpreter works. It's a 
			  simple parser to interpret commands,  that uses 
			  fork/exec functions to create and execute these 
			  commands. I/O redirection and the use of pipes was 
			  required.</li>

			<li>"Myshell" specification: similar to the "bash" 
			  shell, with the following requirements:</li>
			<ol>

			  <li>Execution file: the execution file called
			  "myshell".</li>

			  <li>Shell prompt: If the input to the "myshell" 
			    program is from a terminal, you should print 
			    "myshell>" as the prompt for the user to type in 
			    the shell command. If the input is from a file, 
			    you should not print any prompt, as this will help 
			    when it comes to testing your projects. NOTE: You 
			    can use the "isatty" function to determine whether 
			    the input (via a specific file descriptor) is from 
			    a terminal or not.</li>

			  <li>Command execution and shell termination:
			    "myshell" reads its input from stdin, parsing the 
			    command line to determine how to execute the shell 
			    request. Termination of "myshell" occurs either 
			    when a user types <em>ctrl-d</em>, or when the
			    program issues an "exit()" call due to some 
			    error/termination condition. </li>
			  </ol>
		      </ul>
		      <h4>Description of the valid command lineformats.</h4>
		      <ul>
			<li>"Cmd"--A single command that identifies the 
			  name of a program file.</li>

			<li>"cmd; cmd"--A sequence of commands: "myshell" 
			  should execute them one after another.</li>

			<li>"cmd \> output_file"--Redirect stdout of the cmd 
			  to the file with the name "output_file".</li>

			<li>"cmd \< input_file"--Redirect stdin of the cmd 
			to the file with the name "input_file".</li>

			<li>"cmd 1> output_fil"e--Redirect stdout of the cmd 
				to the file with the name "output_file".</li>

			<li>"cmd 2> output_file" - Redirect stderr of the 
			      cmd to the file with the name "output_file".</li>

			<li>"cmd &> output_file" - Redirect both stdout and 
			      stderr of the cmd to the file with the name 
			      "output_file".</li>

			<li>"cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3" - Pipeline the output of 
			      the command before each "|" symbol to the input
			      of the command after the same "|" symbol.</li>

			<li>"cmd &" - "myshell" should let cmd execute in 
			      the background, so that the shell can interpret 
			      further input commands.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Testing It:</h4>
			<p>At Linux prompt, type <em>gdb myshell</em> , which starts
			  the gdb debugger. It works for some but not all of
			  the specified cases.</p>
			<h4>Test cases that I tried before setting project
			aside for now:</h4>

			<ul>
			  <li>Test: Shell will list all files in directory.</li>

			  <li>Command: ls</li>

			  <li>Test: Shell will first list all files in
			    directory.  Then it will list information
			    about the active processes running.</li>

			  <li>Command: ls;ps</li>

			  <li>Test: Shell will do a directory listing
			    and send it to the output file "lsOutputFile".</li>

			  <li>Command: ls > lsOutputFile</li>

			  <li>Test: Shell will do a directory listing
			    and pipe this output list of directory files 
			    to be the input to the second command
			    running as a process in the shell, grep, 
			    which will then output only the files that 
			    match the string passed as input to grep's 
			    command, "lsOut", and send this list of
			    files to the standard out console output.</li>
			  
			  <li>Command: ls | grep lsOut</li>

			  <li>How I Run and Test it: run gdb with the 
			    myshell binary, and after running it, type 
			    the test cases in the test case file at the
			    shell prompt and then view the output.  In
			    the case you send the output to an output
			    file, after the command is done, you must do
			    the command "more outputFileName.txt" to
			    view the output from the previous command
			    you ran.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Special Input:</h4>
			<ul>
			  <li><em>ctrl-c</em> is the default key sequence to send a 
			    "SIGINT" signal to a process. </li>
			  <li>In "myshell", you should intercept this signal, 
			    and send it to all "foreground" processes to stop 
			    them instead of stopping "myshell".</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Prevent "zombie" children:</h4>
			<ul>
			  <li>when a command running in the background 
			    finishes, it must inform the "myshell" (parent) 
			    process via a "SIGCHLD" signal. </li>
			  <li>"myshell" can then keep track of which child 
			    processes are still active.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Basic Shell operation:</h4>
			<ul>
			  <li>You should use the "fork" syscall to create each 
			    child of "myshell" and then one of the "exec*" 
			    functions to execute the command in the 
			    corresponding child's address space. </li>
			  <li>You should also use either the "wait" or 
			    "waitpid" function to determine the exit status of 
			    a terminating child.</li>
			  <li>For output redirection and piping between 
			    processes: to redirect a file descriptor to stdin, 
			    stdout, or stderr you can use the "dup2"
			    function.</li>
			</ul>
