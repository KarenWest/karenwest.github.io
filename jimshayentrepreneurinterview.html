		  Word Entrepreneur Interview with Jim Shay, CEO of
		  Shay and Glenn Law Firm</a><br>

		  <h4>Jim Shay, Shay and Glenn Law Firm, San Mateo,CA,USA:</h4>

		  <p>My brother is also an entrepreneur on the west coast that
		  I used to contrast the entrepreneur interview I did in the
		  Boston area where I live.  He has small law firm in San
		  Mateo, CA, focusing on intellectual property matters for
		  small companies, primarily in the medical device industry.
		  The firm was founded on November 1, 2006.  A large portion
		  of his work involves interaction with the United States
		  Patent and Trademark Office.  Other than that, government
		  has played no role in the founding or growth of the firm.
		  Philanthropy and philanthropic institutions had no role in
		  the founding or development our firm.  No anchor institution
		  had a role in the founding or development our firm.  No
		  intermediary institution had a role in the founding or
		  development our firm.  He took out a line of credit on his
		  home to provide the start up capital for his firm.</p>

		  <p>In the beginning, their biggest challenge was to hire
		  enough qualified people to meet the initial demand for our
		  services.  Since then, the biggest challenge has been
		  learning how to adapt to the rapidly changing business
		  climate in our primary industry, the start up medical device
		  industry.  The primary element enabling growth has been
		  Jims long time relationships within their primary client
		  community.  The primary measure of their success has been
		  their relative stability over the last eight years even as
		  the overall legal and business landscapes have changed.  The
		  partners and employees of the firm are the primary
		  beneficiaries, but their clients in the biomedical device
		  industries have benefited from that stability as well.</p>
