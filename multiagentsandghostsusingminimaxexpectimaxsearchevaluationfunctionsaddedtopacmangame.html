		  <br><h4>Python Project: Multi Agents Added To Pacman, Including Ghosts, and
			Using Minimax Search Design (and below this, compared
			to the Expectimax Search with a better evaluation function): </h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>We designed agents for the classic version of the
		      Pacman game which was provided to us, including
		      ghosts.</li><br>
		    <li>We implemented minimax search first (and later
		    expectimax search) and tried out evaluation function
		    design.</li><br>
		    <li>We designed a Reflex Pacman Agent that had to consider
		      both food locations and ghost locations in order to
		      perform well.</li><br>
		    <li>We found that this agent would likely die if 2 ghosts 
		      were on the default board, unless the evaluation
		      function was quite good.</li><br>
		    <li>We altered the distance to food by using reciprocal 
		      values to try a new feature.</li><br>
		    <li>The evaluation function evaluates state of the game
		      with an action for that game state as a pair, so that in 
		      later parts of the project, you could evaluate
		      states.</li><br>
		    <li>Default ghosts were random, but you could also use 
		      directional ghosts, and to determine whether our agent 
		      was improving, we ran with fixed random seeds (same
		      random choices every game).</li><br>
		    <li>We then wrote an adversarial agent for Pacman in the 
		      Minimax Agent class and it had to work with any number 
		      of ghosts, with multiple min layers, one for each ghost, 
		      for every max layer.</li><br>
		    <li>We were given an evaluation function which scored the 
		      leaves of the minimax tree.</li><br>
		    <li>A single search play was considered to be one Pacman
		      move and all the ghosts' responses, so depth 2 search 
		      will involve Pacman and each ghost moving 2
		      times.</li><br>
		    <li>The solution was to explore the correct number of game 
		      states, to know whether or not you did your
		      implementation correctly.</li><br>
		    <li>The evaluation function was given to us and checked 
		      that we were evaluating game states rather than actions, 
		      as we were for the reflex agent, who evaluated both food 
		      and ghost locations to perform well.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Look ahead agents evaluate future states where as 
		      reflex agents evaluate actions from the current
		      state.</strong></li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <br><h4>Python Project: Multi Agents Added To Pacman, Including Ghosts, and
			Using Expectimax Search Design with better evaluation functions: </h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li><strong>Playing On Large Pacman boards</strong>: Pacman was good at not
		      dying but quite bad at winning.</li><br>
		    <li>He thrashed around and when next to a dot, would not
		      eat it because he did not know where he'd go after
		      eating the dot.</li><br>
		    <li>If Pacman thought his death was unavoidable, he tried
		      to end the game ASAP, because of the constant penalty
		      for living, and with random ghosts not always the best 
		      choice, but Minimax agents always assume the
		      worst.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Alpha-Beta pruning agent:</strong> to more
		      efficiently explore the minimax tree.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Alpha-Beta Agent's minimax values:</strong> were identical 
		      to the Minimax Agent minimax values, although the 
		      actions it selects can vary because of different 
		      tie breaking behavior.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>The code worked if:</strong> the correct number of game states 
		      were explored and it was important that we performed 
		      alpha beta tree pruning without reordering a node's
		      children.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Successor states</strong> had to be processed in the correct
		      order.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Alpha-Beta pruning</strong> was not done on
		      all of a node's children, so an equal amount of
		      alpha-beta pruning was not done for each game state
		      explored.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Expectimax Agent</strong>: useful for modeling 
		      <em>probabilistic behavior of agents who may make suboptimal
		      choices.</em></li><br>
		    <li><strong>Random ghosts</strong> are not optimal minimax
		      agents.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Expectimax Agents:</strong> no longer take the
		      minimum over all ghost actions, but the expectation is
		      according to your agent's model of how the ghosts
		      act.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>To simplify:</strong> we assumed we would be
		      <em>running against an adversary which chose amongst their
		      legal action list uniformly at random.</em></li><br>
		    <li><strong>We Noticed:</strong> a more cavalier approach
		      in close quarters with ghosts.  If Pacman perceives that
		      he could be trapped but might escape to grab a few more
		      pieces of food, he'll at least try.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>A better evaluation function:</strong> it
		      evaluated future states, rather than actions from the 
		      current state, as the reflex agent did.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Evaluation function features:</strong> based
		      on how important you think it is, such as distance to
		      food, locations of ghosts, etc.</li><br>
