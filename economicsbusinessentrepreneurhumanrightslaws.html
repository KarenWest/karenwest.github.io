			  All links now work.  However, the web site is still
			  under construction, since while building it, I
			  learned how better to design it going forward.
			  Future Plans are to shorten web pages if they are 
			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do

		Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurs in Transitioning Economies class files</a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>
		  
		  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This course examined economies
		  for start up companies, first looking at Cleveland, OH,
		  since that is where Case Western University is located, and
		  it did not used to have many resources or a good reputation
		  for starting a company there.  Each week the course examined
		  the pros and cons of a resource for starting a company
		  outside of venture capital money and then it asked you to
		  examine your own local ecosystem, mine being Boston,MA, to
		  see what resources exist here for start ups.</p>

		  <h4>Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurs in
		    Transitioning Economies Topics included:</h4>

		  <ul>

		    <li>The role of anchor institutions for
		    entrepreneurs</li><br>

			<li>when company started</li><br>
			<li>the company mission</li><br>

			<li>Supports available to help company
			succeed</li><br>

		  <h4>Technical Entrepreneur, 2 courses, Part 1 and 2:</h4>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/technicalEntrepreneurPart1">Link to
		Technical Entrepreneur Part 1, Fiction Recommender Project,
		and the Brainstorm of Ideas class files and Part 1 topics</a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>

		  <p><strong>Objective Part 1:</strong> fundamentals of
		    technical entrepreneurship, pioneered in Silicon Valley
		    and spreading across the world.</p>

		  <h4>What We Learned:</h4>
		  <ul>
		    <li>We learned the process technical entrepreneurs use to
		    start companies.</li><br>
		    <li>It involved taking a technical idea and finding high
		    potential commercial support, gathering resources such as
		    talent and capital, figuring out how to sell and market
		    the idea, and manage rapid growth.</li><br>
		    <li><strong> It demonstrated the entrepreneurial mind set: <em>where
		    others see insurmountable problems, entrepreneurs look for
		    opportunities in technology and business
		    solutions.</em></strong></li><br>
		    <li><strong><em>The idea was that an entrepreneur's
		    perspective is an excellent way of thinking</em> in order to
		    tackle new opportunities in social entrepreneurship,
		    whether with governments or NGO
		    (non-government-organizations).</strong></li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <p><strong>Part 1 Overview: My team project was
		    with team leader Amber Chang, who came up with a <em>fiction 
		    recommender social web site.</em></strong>  We each provided
		    brainstorms of ideas, and my list of ideas was included
		    in the provided class files link, but Amber asked me to
		    join her team and I did, rather than pursue mine for
		    this part of the class.  I'll list mine below that we did
		    NOT pursue in this class project.  We were asked to
		    submit these and mine were from what I thought about
		    through life experience and conversations with others,
		    some are from what the internet search gave me, and some
		    just observations from being out and about.  We explored
		    Ambers idea for the class project, but I share mine with you
		    for fun.  These are what I had to submit before we did
		    pursue the fiction recommender for the class project.</p>

		      <li>For this project, we tested

		  <h4>Technical Entrepreneur Part 2, the Passport Social
		    Website Geared Toward the Travel Industry</h4>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/technicalEntrepreneurPart2">Link to
		    Technical Entrepreneur Part 2, Passport Social Website Project,
		    For the Travel Industry, and the topics covered in Part 2</a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>
		  
		  <p><strong>Objective Part 2:</strong> Technical Entrepreneur
		    Part 2 further explored the fundamentals of technology
		    entrepreneurship.</p>

		  <ul>
		    <li>We learned the process technology entrepreneurs use to
		      take a validated idea to the larger market and scale
		      their startup.</li><br>
		    <li><em><strong>The class demonstrated the entrepreneurial
			  mindset: where others see insurmountable problems,
			  entrepreneurs look for opportunities in technology
			  and business solutions.</strong></em></li><br>
		    <li>An entrepreneurial perspective is also a way of
		      thinking in order to tackle new opportunities in social 
		      entrepreneurship, whether it is in government or NGOs
		      (non government organizations).</li><br>
		    <li>Part 2 of this class covers an opportunity execution
		      project (OEP), where you test the rest of the aspects of
		      the business model and figure out how to actually
		      commercialize the product or service.</li>
		    <li>In Part 2 of Technical Entrepreneur, my partner from
		      Part 1 with whom we did the Fiction Recommender Web
		      Site, did not participate in Part 2, so instead, I
		      joined the Pass Port Social Web Site Team, with Will
		      Bruner whom asked me to join his team and later a side 
		      venture start up in wearable computing, although I never 
		      did end up joining the real life venture he was
		      investigating at this time.</li><br>
		    <li>Opportunity Execution Project (OEP): The Passport
		      Social Website was similar in many ways to FaceBook,
		      except geared toward the travel industry, with different
		      levels of membership, where you could follow friends as
		      they traveled and be directed to a travel web site if you
		      were interested in a similar vacation.</li><br>

		  <h4>European Union (EU) Business Law:</h4>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EuropeanEUBusinessLaw">Link to
		  European Business (EU) Business Law Class Files</a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>

		  <p><strong>Overview: Note that this course was taken in
		      2014, before Brexit.</strong> The European Union is one
		      of the world's largest and most important
		      economies. Those interested in doing business with the
		      EU member states must know the rules and the practice of
		      relevant laws. The course was designed to give students
		      the essentials of European Union Business Law.  This
		      introductory course provided students with the
		      fundamental tools they need in order to be able to do
		      business with the EU, whether they live in Europe or
		      elsewhere. Students gained an understanding of both the
		      practical and theoretical aspects of European business
		      law and how the EU's Internal Market operates in a
		      global context. The focus was on topics central to
		      business law and to economic analysis, such as free
		      movement law, competition law, environmental law, trade
		      law and state aids law. Students gained a general
		      understanding of the European Union’s legal system and
		      explore the basic constitutional foundations of the
		      European Union.  Students learned how to find and use EU
		      legal material.  Throughout the course, qualified
		      researchers with experience from working with the courts
		      and institutions of the European Union and in private
		      practice gave lectures.</p>

		  <h4>International Human Rights:</h4>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/InternationalHumanRights">Link to
		    International Human Rights Class Files</a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>

		  <h4>Course topics:</h4>
		  <ul>
		    <li>What are Human Rights</li><br>
		    <li>To What Situations Do Human Rights Apply</li><br>
		    <li>When May Human Rights Be Restricted</li><br>
		    <li>When Must the State Intervene To Protect Human
		      Rights</li><br>

		    <li>How Are Human Rights Protected At A Domestic
		      Level?</li><br>
		    <li>How Are Human Rights Protected At An International
		    Level?</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> International human rights
		  law, unquestionably an exciting field, is also complex and
		  demanding. Professor Olivier de Schutter of the Unviersity
		  of Louvain, Belgium, focused on international human rights
		  law as global legal system, rather than as a collection of
		  different (though related) rights, giving it relevance and
		  immediacy.  Drawing on cases and materials from a wide range
		  of sources, he showed how human rights law is used as a tool
		  to address contemporary issues such as counter terrorism,
		  global poverty and religious diversity. Materials were
		  organized thematically, allowing readers to make comparisons
		  and connections between different legal treaties and
		  systems. Students were also easily able to assess how human
		  rights are protected under domestic and international
		  laws. The law was placed in context throughout, ensuring
		  full understanding of why laws exist and how they work.</p>

		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/InternationalCriminalLaw">Link to
		    International Criminal Law Class Files</a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>
		  
		  <p><strong>About the Course:</strong> From the Nuremberg
		  trial to the case against Saddam Hussein, from the
		  prosecution of Al Qaeda terrorists to the trial of Somali
		  pirates, no area of law is as important to world peace and
		  security as international criminal law.  Taught by one of
		  the worlds leading experts in the field, this course
		  educated students about the fundamentals of international
		  criminal law and policy.</p>

		  <h4>We explored the contours of international crimes such
		    as:</h4>
		  <ul>
		    <li>genocide</li><br>
		    <li>war crimes</li><br>
		    <li>terrorism</li><br>
		    <li>and piracy</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <p>We examined unique modes of international criminal
		    liability and specialized defenses.  And we delved into
		    the challenges of obtaining custody of the accused and 
		    maintaining control of the courtroom.</p><br>

		  <h4>Course Topics: This course comprised eight units. Each
		  included an assigned reading, typically an article or book

		    coperpetration, and incitement</li><br>
		    <li>Special defenses: insanity, obedience to orders,
		    duress, and head of state immunity</li><br>
		    <li>Gaining custody of the accused: extradition, luring,
