			  All links now work.  However, the web site is still
			  under construction, since while building it, I
			  learned how better to design it going forward.
			  Future Plans are to shorten web pages if they are 
			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do
			  that too. <br><strong>NOTE: LEFT HAND COLUMN
			  LINKS:</strong> Recent and on going online projects
			  and learning in both technical areas and business 
			  humanities.<br><strong>NOTE: MAIN PAGE:</strong> Details

		  <br><h4>Entrepreneur Interview with Marina Kristel, Speech
		  and Language Pathologist</h4><br>
		  <a href="MarinaKristelEntrepreneurInterview.docx">Microsoft
		  Word Entrepreneur Interview with Marina Kristel, Speech and
		  Language Pathologist</a><br>

		  <h4>Marina Kristel: Northeast Speech and Language Pathology,
		  PC, Albany,NY,USA:</h4>


		  <p>My next entrepreneur interview was from my home town of
		  Albany,NY, a friend of mine from high school who became a
		  speech pathologist.  Below is the description of Marina
		  Kristels speech pathology business in Niskayuna,NY, just
		  outside Albany, <strong>quoted in her own words.</strong>
		  Marina also started a 2nd business that she did not detail
		  here, something she does in her spare time, called “Snappy
		  Suits”, clothing for babies.</p>

		  <p>The name of my corporation is Northeast Speech Language
		  Pathology, PC. I am located in Niskayuna New York. I began a
		  private practice under my personal sir name in 1991, then
		  incorporated under this aforementioned name in 2003. My
		  mission is to reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia
		  both in the community and in skilled nursing
		  facilities. Aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of
		  death in skilled nursing facilities and the fifth leading 
		  cause of death in the elderly living in the
		  community.</p>

		  <p>My services include evaluating and providing treatment
		  for people with dysphagia (swallowing disorders) using
		  Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES).</p>

		  <p>In 1995, New York State recognized licensed speech
		  language pathologists to include dysphagia in their scope of
		  practice.  It had previously been recognized in the scope
		  through the federal law (Medicare regulations) and American
		  Speech Language Hearing Association.</p>

		  <p>The FEES aspect of the business was initiated in 1999
		  with the business taking a bank loan and purchasing "$24,000"
		  worth of equipment. The corporation began expanding its
		  territory to provide these exams in both NY & MA in
		  2011. Massachusetts was included in the expansion due to
		  prime candidates and patients being held up in Trach and Vent
		  facilities, where aspiration pneumonia is most prevalent. At
		  this time, the business grew exponentially.</p>

		  <p>The government, nor philanthropic contributions, nor any
		  institutions helped to start up the company. This was
		  started solely by the private practitioner.</p>

		  <p>The challenges included convincing skilled nursing
		  administrators and their medical directors (high ranking
		  MDs) the benefits of this procedure versus their current
		  means to address patients with dysphagia. Change is very
		  challenging. Continuous research, marketing, making
		  presentations within the medical community, while working &
		  balancing a family has been the biggest challenge. Being a
		  woman among a majority of male physicians, respiratory
		  therapists and administrators is an added challenge. The few
		  female physicians, nurse practitioners, and directors of
		  nursing also often have presented themselves as very
		  noncommittal and reserved, who are among the primary decision
		  makers in the skilled nursing facilities.</p>

		  <p>As the company grew during the past five years, doors
		  opened for the opportunity to incorporate education and
		  provide classes to employees and direct care staff of the
		  nursing home residents. This has been the optimal means for
		  preventing aspiration pneumonia. Training the staff that
		  feed and verbally redirect these residents simply on safe
		  strategies to eat, drink, take medication, and prevent
		  dental disease is the direct route to preventing the initial
		  problem from starting and improving a condition caused by
		  various medical diagnoses.</p>

		  <p>The success of this company is not based on
		  income. Success is reducing the incidence of aspiration
		  pneumonia in the community and in skilled nursing
		  facilities. The United States is spending "$87 billion" per
		  year addressing aspiration pneumonia. Educating and
		  assessing the swallow with this gold standard instrumental
		  exam known as FEES, will enable the in house Speech language
		  pathologist to know the physiology of their patients
		  swallow, the least restrictive diet texture and liquid
		  consistency, what strategies are necessary in order to
		  safely swallow, and what plan of treatment (including
		  swallowing and strengthening exercises) are necessary.</p>

		  <p>The beneficiaries of this success are the patients, both
		  young and old, as well as the governments money (coming
		  from both Medicare and private insurance companies) which
		  ultimately comes from the people of the United States.</p>
