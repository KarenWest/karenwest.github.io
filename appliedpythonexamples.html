DFS and BFS and optimization were used for graph searches of related objects.
optimization problems, dynamic programming, fitting data to linear and quadratic curves, normal distributions, measuring goodness of fit of data to a curve, uniform distributions, estimating Pi, Monty Hall Problems, number of samples needed for a coin flip experiment, variance and standard deviation, plotted histograms, causal and predictive nondeterminism, stochastic processes, monte carlo simulations, hash tables, random walks and simulation models, examined different algorithms for searching and sorting and their Big O Notation performances.  

Optimization Problems: This lecture example Python code demonstrated code optimization.  You start with an objective function and a set of constraints the solution must satisfy.  Examples were the n-queens problem, where you place n-queens on an NxN board so that no 2 queens attack each other (no 2 queens share the same row, column or diagonal).  Other examples were bin packing, cutting stock and min cut networks and the traveling salesmen problem.  The challenge shown was that these problems are "hard" to solve.  Often finding optimal solutions requires examining all possible combinations of items.  The time to examine all combinations grows exponentially with the number of items.  "Real World" problems have a large number of items.  The next set of examples were the burglar's dilemma, 0/1 knapsack problem, and greedy algorithms.  Which metric works best? Max. value, min. weight or max-value / weight.  Greedy Algorithm is a heuristic for a 0/1 knapsack problem.  Given materials of different value/weight ratios, find the most valuable combination of materials which fit in a knapsack of fixed capacity W. Greedy algorithm with max value/weight metric finds optimal solution for continuous knapsack problem.  Optimal solution for 0/1 knapsack problem - formal problem statement: Given vectors of weight wi, and values vi, where 0 <= i <= N-1 items; knapsack holds W.  Find 0/1 vector ti.  Technique exhaustive search enumerates all possible combinations of items and choose the best one that satisfies all constraints.  Generate the power set combinations of all items.  Greedy was O(N log N) and Optimal was O(N 2**N). 

Dynamic Programming:  The dynamic programming using optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.  In the Fibonacci example the memoize function was used to demonstrate using function arguments as a sequence, which works for immutable / hashable arguments.  The memoize function remembers previously computed answers, much like a cache does in hardware.  It showed knapsack subproblems where you try different ways to optimize a long search, such as to not take the first item in the knapsack, then take the 1st item in the knapsack, combine the 2 solutions and see if there are overlaps.  Code examples (in link for this entry) applied these optimizations to find where to place line breaks in a paragraph to minimize "badness".  The line break subproblems first tried a solution with no line breaks after 1st word, then another with a line break after 1st word, and combined the solutions to find overlaps.  Another code example demonstrated the minimum cost of alignment between 2 sequences.
