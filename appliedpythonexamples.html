			<p id="notice"><strong><br>UNDER CONSTRUCTION WEB SITE</strong>,
			  All links now work.  However, the web site is still
			  under construction, since while building it, I
			  learned how better to design it going forward.
			  Future Plans are to shorten web pages if they are 
			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do
			  that too. <br><strong>NOTE: LEFT HAND COLUMN
			  LINKS:</strong> Recent and on going online projects
			  and learning in both technical areas and business 
			  humanities.<br><strong>NOTE: MAIN PAGE:</strong> Details 
			  Professional Work Experience, Formal Education (BS
			  and MS) along with recent online learning summaries</p>

			simulations, hash tables, random walks and simulation
			models, examined different algorithms for searching
			and sorting and their Big O Notation performances.
			This lecture example Python code
			demonstrated <em><strong>
			  code optimization</strong></em>.    
		      You start with an objective function and a set of
			constraints the solution must satisfy.  Examples were 
		      the n-queens problem, where you place n-queens on an NxN
			board so that no 2 queens
		    attack each other (no 2 queens share the same row, column
		    or diagonal).  Other examples were bin packing, cutting
		    stock and min cut networks and the traveling salesmen
		    problem.  The challenge shown was that these problems are
		    "hard" to solve.  Often finding optimal solutions requires
		    examining all possible combinations of items.  The time to
		    examine all combinations grows exponentially with the
		    number of items.  "Real World" problems have a large
		    number of items.  <em><strong>Dynamic
			Programming</strong></em>
		      :  The dynamic programming using
		    optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.  In the
		    Fibonacci example the memoize function was used to
		    demonstrate using function arguments as a sequence, which
		    works for immutable / hashable arguments.  The memoize
		    function remembers previously computed answers, much like
		    a cache does in hardware.</li><br>
