		    non-Compliance  </a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>Stochastic Simulation of Patient Virus Population 
		      Dynamics: Effect of Delaying Drug Treatment on Patient 
		      Disease, Using 2 Drugs, Patient non-Compliance</li><br>

		    <li>We used the classes implemented in the previous
		    similar problem set in this project list (ResistantVirus, 
		      TreatedPatient).</li><br>

		    <li>In this problem set, we examined the effect of 
		      delaying treatment on the ability of the drug to 
		      eradicate the virus population.</li><br>

		    <li>We needed multiple simulations to observe trends in 
		      the distributions of patient outcomes.</li><br>

		    <li>In the last part of the previous similar problem set, 
		      we ran a simulation that consisted of 150 time steps 
		      before adding drug guttagonol, followed by another 150 
		      time steps.</li><br>

		    <li>Here we run the same simulation but this time for 300, 
		      150, 75 and 0 time steps before adding guttagonol to the 
		      patient, and then ran another 150 time steps.</li><br>

		    <li>We used the same init params as problem set 8 (refer 
		      to that description).</li><br>

		    <li>For each case, we repeated the experiment for enough 
		      trials to gain reasonable insight into the expected 
		      result.</li><br>

		    <li>Rather than averaging the final virus population 
		      across different trials as in the previous problem set, 
		      we used pylab's hist() function to plot a histogram of 
		      the final virus populations under each case for each 
		      trial.</li><br>

		    <li>The x-axis of the histogram was the final virus 
		      population values, and the y-axis the number of trials 
		      belonging to each histogram bin.</li><br>

		    <li>We had to justify the number of trials we ran for each 
		      case in order to obtain a reasonable
		      distribution.</li><br>
		    
		    <li>We filled in the function simulationDelayedTreatment
		      (numTrials) to perform this simulation.  With a delay of 
		      300 and 150 cases, "0-5%" were cured, for 75, "6-15%", 
		      for 0, "86-100%", so the earlier the drug was applied 
		      the more likely for this virus it was to be
		      cured.</li><br>

		    <li>We then examined these same things with 2 drugs and 
		      found it cured the patient more quickly when
		      administered early for this virus.</li><br>

		    <li>We also discussed how to model a patient that refuses 
		      to take medication.  You make a TreatedPatient class 
		      that stochastically does not take its medication, and 
		      ir predicted less patients would be cured.</li><br>
