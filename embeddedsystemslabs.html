			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do

		  <p><em>Each lab completed first in simulation and then on
		  the real "Launch" board, using the Keil tools.</em></p><br>
		  <p>Topics (More Details Follow Topic List) of Labs to Review 
		    Embedded Systems while not working, the area I had worked 
		    in for 18 years.</p><br>
		    
		  <ul>
		    <li>Ultimate Goal of course was to have an small systems 
		      approach to game design, to design and test a 
		      retro-hand-held-vide-game, integrating all labs from the 
		      class into this final thing, which was optional, and in 
		      the process, learn about microcontrollers. I opted to do 
		      all the labs, but have not yet put them all together 
		      into this form.  I have an example of what it would be
		      like if I did.</li><br>
		    <li>ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion) and Data
		      Acquisition: We developed a system that inputs an analog
		      signal with an analog to digital  converter within the 
		      microcontroller.</li><br>
		    <li>We developed a simple autonomous robot that used two 
		      DC motors and two distance sensors.</li><br>
		    <li>We designed and tested a position measurement system, 
		      with analog to digital conversion and calibrated
		      output.</li><br>
		    <li>DAC (Digital to Analog Conversion) and Sound: We 
		      developed a system that outputs an analog signal with an 
		      R-2R digital to analog converter.</li><br>
		    <li>We design and tested a digital piano, with 4 inputs, 
		      digital to analog conversion, and sound.</li><br>
		    <li>Interrupts: We developed a system that outputs a 
		      square wave using interrupts, followed by developing a 
		      system that inputs from a switch using interrupts.</li><br>
		    <li>We developed a system that outputs to a DC motor using 
		      pulse width modulation.</li><br>
		    <li>We designed and test a guitar tuner, producing a 440 
		      Hz tone.</li><br>
		    <li>UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) - 
		      The Serial Interface and I/O Synchronization: We 
		      developed a communication network using the serial 
		      port. We Wrote C code to output decimal and fixed-point 
		      numbers to the serial port.</li><br>
		    <li>Finite State Machines: We developed a simple vending 
		      machine using a finite state machine.</li><br>
		    <li>We developed a stepper motor robot using a finite 
		      state machine.  We interfaced 3 switches and 6 LEDs and 
		      created a traffic light finite state machine.</li><br> 
		    <li>Arrays and Functional Debugging.  We developed a 
		      system that debugs by dumping data into an array.  We 
		      Wrote C functions using array data structures that 
		      collected data to debug our system.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		    Acquisition Project Labs</h4><br>

		      to digital  converter</li><br>
		    <li>an autonomous robot that uses two DC motors and two 
		      distance sensors</li><br>
		    <li>a test and position measurement lab, with analog to 
		      digital conversion and calibrated output</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  conversion: </h4><br>

		    <li>read the digital result</li><br>

		  </ul>
		  <ul></ul>
		  <p><em><strong>Successive Approximation - Microcontroller's
		  best method for designing ADC</strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The most pervasive method for designing the ADC in 
			this microcontroller is successive approximation.</li><br>
		    <li>A 12-bit successive approximation ADC is clocked 12 
			times.</li><br>
		    <li>At each clock another bit is determined 
			starting with the most significant bit.</li><br>
		    <li>For each clock, the successive approximation hardware issues a 
			guess on Vdac by sitting the bit under test to 1.</li><br>
		    <li>If Vdac is then higher than the input bit Vin, then the 
			bit under test is cleared.</li><br>
		    <li>If Vdac is less than Vin then the bit under test
		    remains 1.</li><br>

		    <li>used SysTick interrupts to implement a software PWM 
			(pulse width modulator) to drive two DC motors at

		    <li>Two analog IR (InfrRed) distance sensors: used to

			are mounted looking forward to the left and forward 
			to the right.  The goal is to control power to each 
			wheel so the left and right distances to the walls are 
			equal.</li><br>
		    <li>A third IR sensor looks directly forward to 
			  attempt to avoid a head-on collision.  If an object 
			  is detected too close to the front of the robot, 
			  both wheels are immediately stopped.</li><br>

		  <p><em><strong>What we Learned from This Lab Project</strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>intro. to sampling analog signals using the ADC 
			interface</li><br>
		    <li>development of ADC device driver</li><br>
		    <li>learning data conversion and calibration
		      techniques</li><br>
		    <li>the use of fixed-point-numbers, which are integers 
			used to represent non-integer values</li><br>
		    <li>development of an interrupt-driven real-time
			sampling device driver</li><br>
		    <li>development of a software system using multiple
			files</li><br>
		    <li>learn how to debug one module at a time</li>  <br>
		  </ul>
		  <p><em><strong>How We Used Potentiometer, Resistance and the
		  microcontroller SysTick interrupt to convert analog sample
		  to distance:</strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
                    <li>A linear slide potentiometer converts distance into 
		    resistance "(0 <= R <= 10 kiloOhms)".  The software uses
	            the 12--bit ADC in microcontroller sampled at 40 Hz using 
		    SysTick interrupts.  A function converts the ADC sample 
		    into distance: units of 0.001 cm.</li><br>
		    <li>Data stream: will be passed from the ISR (interrupt
		      service routeine) into the main program using a mailbox, 
		      and the main program will output the data on a
		      display.</li><br>
		    <li>Microcontroller ADC: input from potentiometer: converts 
		      the input voltage to a number from 0 to 4095.  The ADC 
		      is a successive approximation device with a conversion 
		      time on the order of several microseconds.</li><br>
                    <li>Software: calculates distance with a resolution of
		      0.001 cm.</li><br>
		    <li>Position measurements: should be displayed on the Nokia 
		      display through UART0.  A periodic interrupt can be used 
		      for the real-time sampling.</li><br>
		    <li>Distance resolution: smallest change in distance that 
		      the system can reliably detect.  Resolution depends on 
		      electrical noise, number of ADC bits, and the resolution 
		      of the output display software.  Accuracy is defined as 
		      the absolute difference between the true position and
		      the value measured by the device.</li><br>  
		    <li>The armature is defined as the part that moves, and in 
		      this lab we were measuring the position of the armature, 
		      which in this lab is the slide potentiometer.</li><br>
		    </ul>
		  <h4>DAC (Digital to Analog Conversion and Sound)--an R2R DAC 3-bit desgin example:</h4><br>
		  <p><em><strong>In this class example, we created a sine wave analog
		    output from digital inputs using an R2R 3bit design for
		    the Digital to Analog (DAC)
		    conversion.</strong></em></p><br>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_DAC_R2R_3bitDesign">Link
		    to embedded systems Lab Files, and R2R Digital to Analog
		    Conversion and Sound, a 3 bit design example</a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>We had to generate a 100 Hz sine wave whose table size
		      was 16 entries of integers that when sent to the output
		      port would create the various levels of the sine wave,
		      so we needed a 100Hz*16 = 1.6 kHz interrupt.</li><br>
		    <li>Each time the SysTick interrupt handler was run it
		      output one of the 16 voltage levels that created the
		      output sine wave.</li><br>
		    <li>The bus is 80MHz, so SysTick period was
		      80000kHz/1.6kHz = 50000 for the sine wave.</li><br>
		    <li>Each time the switch was pressed, it either activated
		      playing this 100Hz sound wave, or stopped it.</li><br>
		  </ul>
		  <h4>Digital Piano Example using Digital to Analog
		  (DAC):</h4><br>
		  <p><em><strong>The 3 objectives were to:</strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>learn about DAC conversion</li><br>
		    <li>learn how digital data stored in a computer could be
		      used to represent sounds and music</li><br>
		    <li>study how the DAC and interrupts can be used to create
		    sounds</li><br>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The lab created a 4 note output digital piano.  The DAC
		    is 4 bits, but the example we did in class was 3 bits.</p><br>

		  <h4>Interrupts: Softsound Example</h4><br>
		  <p><em><strong>This class example used the SysTick timer to request
		    interrupts at 500Hz.  It helped prepare us to do the
		    tuning fork example at 440 Hz.</strong></em></p><br>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_Interrupts_SoftSound">Link
		    to embedded systems class Files, Softsound Example</a><br>

		  <h4>Tuning Fork Example with interrupts:</h4><br> 
		  <p><em><strong>The square wave sound is 440 Hz, a standard frequency
		    made by a tuning fork.  A positive logic switch was the
		    input, and headphones were used as an output.  A resistor
		    placed in series with the output to the headphone speaker
		    controls the loudness (larger resistor, quieter sound, but
		    never go off).
		  </strong></em></p><br>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_Lab12_Interrupts_TuningFork">Link
		    to embedded systems lab files, Tuning Fork Lab</a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>Pressing the switch: the square wave sound begins, press
		    it again, it stops.  When the output was oscillating, the
		    period was 1/440 sec = 2.2727ms, so interrupt at 1/880 Hz
		    = 1.13636 ms.</li><br>
		    <li>The time "t" between touching a switch and the change in
		    output need not be immediate, as long as the toggling
		    begins before the next SysTick interrupt.</li><br>
		    <li>The resistance of the headphones is 32 ohms, and Power
		    (P) = Volts (V) * Current (I), and the output high voltage
		    is 3.3 volts, and the in series resistor from the output
		    to the headphones is 1500 ohms.</li><br>
		    <li>So the current delivered to the headphones was: I = 3.3 /
		    (1500 + 32) Amps.</li><br>
		  <li>The power delivered to the headphones should be less than
		    1 milliwatt, and with P = I**2 * 32 ohms, with R = 1500
		    ohms, the power delivered = 0.15 mW.</li><br>
		  <li>Sound was created only when the voltage across the
		    speaker oscillated.</li><br>
		  <li>The frequency of the oscillation will determine the pitch
		    of the sound.</li><br>
		  <li>Frequency 440 Hz: note A, above middle C on the piano.</li>
		  <li>To output silence, it requires less energy to leave the
		    output low.</li><br>
		  <li>An unchanging output results in no sound from the
		    speaker, but it also requires current to flow through the
		    electromagnet in the speaker.</li><br>
		  <li>The PLL(Phase Locked Loop): runs at 80 MHz.  With the
		    SysTick interrupt, we found that timing was more accurate
		    than software loop delays, and creating the 440 Hz wave
		    with the 880 Hz interrupt worked better.</li><br>
		  <li>SysTick interrupt service routine: looked at the state of
		    switch and tracked whether the switch was pressed during
		    the previous ISR service to know whether to toggle or
		    quiet the output.</li><br>
		  <li>We checked the output wave period as 1000 ms for one
		    toggle cycle (high and low) divided by 2.272 ms = 440 Hz

		  <h4>Phase Lock Loops (PLL): A software function to change
		  the bus frequency using the PLL:</h4><br> 
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_FSM_PhaseLockLoopPLL">Link
		    to embedded systems Lab Files, Phase Lock Loop (PLL)</a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li> Being able to dynamically control bus frequency and
		      I/O devices is important for low-power design.</li><br>
		    <li>The execution speed of a microcontroller is determined 
		      by an external crystal.</li><br>
		    <li>The microcontroller board we used had a 16 MHz
		    crystal.</li><br>
		    <li>Most microcontrollers include a phase lock loop (PLL) that 
		    allows the software to adjust the execution speed of the
		    computer.</li><br>
		    <li>Typically, the choice of frequency involves the
		    tradeoff between software execution speed and electrical
		    power.</li><br>
		    <li>In other words, slowing down the bus clock will
		    require less power to operate and generate less
		    heat.</li><br>
		    <li>Speeding up the bus clock obviously allows for more
		    calculations per second, at the cost of requiring more
		    power to operate and generating more heat.</li><br>
		    <li>The default bus speed for the microcontroller internal 
		      oscillator is 16 MHz ±1%.</li><br>
		    <li>The internal oscillator is significantly less
		    precise than the crystal, but it requires less power and
		    does not need an external crystal.</li><br>
		    <li>If we wish to have accurate control of time, we will 
		      activate the external crystal (called the main
		      oscillator) to use the PLL to select the desired bus
		      speed.</li><br>
		    <li>There are two ways to activate the PLL. We could call
		      a library function, or we could access the clock
		      registers directly.</li><br>
		    <li>To save power, we slow down the bus frequency removing
		      as much of the wasted bus cycles while still performing
		      all of the required tasks.  For battery-powered systems
		      the consumed power is a critical factor.</li><br>

		  <h4>SysTick Timers and their accuracy:</h4><br>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_FSM_SysTickTimer">Link
		    to embedded systems class example files on Sys Tick Timers </a><br>


		  <ul>
		    <li>The accuracy of SysTick depends on the accuracy of the
		      clock.</li><br>
		    <li>We use the PLL to derive a bus clock based on the 16
		      MHz crystal, the time measured or generated using
		      SysTick will be very accurate.</li><br>
		    <li>More specifically, the accuracy of the NX5032GA
		      crystal on the LaunchPad board is ±50 parts per million
		      (PPM), which translates to 0.005%, which is about ±5
		      seconds per day.</li><br>
		    <li>One could spend more money on the crystal and improve
		      the accuracy by a factor of 10. Not only are crystals
		      accurate, they are stable. The NX5032GA crystal will
		      vary only ±150 PPM as temperature varies from -40 to
		      +150oC.</li><br>
		    <li>Crystals are more stable than they are accurate, 
		      typically varying by less than 5 PPM per year.</li><br>
		    <li>We learned how to implement time delays based on
		      SysTick. The RELOAD register is set to the number of bus 
		      cycles one wishes to wait. If the PLL function has been 
		      executed, then the units of this delay will be 12.5 ns. 
		      Writing to CURRENT will clear the counter and will clear 
		      the count flag (bit 16) of the CTRL register.  After
		      SysTick has been decremented delay times, the count flag
		      will be set and the while loop will terminate. Since
		      SysTick is only 24 bits, the maximum time one can wait
		      with SysTick_Wait is 224*12.5ns, which is about 200
		      ms.</li><br>
		    <li>To provide for longer delays, the function
		      SysTick_Wait10ms calls the function SysTick_Wait
		      repeatedly. Notice that 800,000*12.5ns is 10ms.  What 
		      is the longest time one could wait using
		      SysTick_Wait10ms?  The maximum delay is 232 * 10ms, 
		      which is about 500 days.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <h4>Finite State Machines (Mealy and Moore):</h4><br>

                  <ul>
		    <li><strong>To Introduce Finate State Machines:</strong> 
		      <ul>
			<li>We learned to use the static timer to get precise
			  delays.</li><br>
			<li>Precision like this is required in real time
			  systems where not meeting delays can have
			  consequences, ranging from minor inconveniences to
			  serious catastrophes (air traffic control, nuclear
			  power plants, anti-lock brakes in a car,
			  etc).</li><br>
			<li>We learned to build an abstraction called a finite
			  state machine which makes as a design, complex
			  systems using a simple abstraction that lends itself
			  to probability of function.</li><br>
			<li>FSMs are a design process that is easy to verify
			  and has a set of theory behind it.</li><br>
			<li>The same engine we build for one FSM can be used
			  no matter how complex the system is.</li><br>
			<li>An FSM is a 5-tuple: sets of: inputs, outputs,
			  states, transitions (STG = state transition graph,
			  and a matrix can be used too), and output
			  determination.</li>
			<li>The Moore FSM was the focus for this class, where the
			  next state is a function of current state and input,
			  and the output is a function of the current
			  state.</li><br>
			<li>Mealy machines are not covered in this class, but
			  their output is a function of the current state and
			  the input.</li><br>

		      <br><a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_FSM_OddOnesDetector">Link
			to embedded systems Lab Files, Odd Ones Detector Finite
			State Machine</a><br>

		      <ul>
			<li>For the odd ones detector shown in the code link,
			  the input is a bit, either one or zero, as is the
			  output.</li><br>
			<li>There are 2 states, even and odd.</li><br>
			<li>When in even state and input = 1, you go to odd
			  state where output = 1.</li><br>
			<li>When in even state and input = 0, we stay in even
			  state and output = 0.</li><br>
			<li>When in odd state and input = 1, you go to even
			  state and output = 0.</li><br>
			<li>When in odd state and input = 0, you stay in the
			  odd state and output = 1.</li><br>
			<li>This is a very, very simple Moore FSM to
			demonstrate the concept.</li><br>
			<li>The time delay is 1 sec. spent in each
			state.<li><br>

			(FSM) First Example</strong>
			  <br><a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_FSM_TrafficLight">Link to
			    embedded systems class files for the Traffic Light
			    Controller Class Example Finite State Machine</a><br>

		      <ul>
			<li>We designed a traffic light controller for the
			  intersection of two equally busy one-way
			  streets.<li><br>
			<li> The Solution: The intersection has two one-ways
			  roads with the same amount of traffic: North and
			  East.</li><br>
			<li>We begin the design defining what constitutes a
			state.</li><br>
			<li>In this system, a state describes which road has
			  authority to cross the intersection.</li><br>
			<li>The basic idea, of course, is to prevent
			  southbound cars to enter the intersection at the
			  same time as westbound cars.</li><br>
			<li>In this system, the light pattern defines which
			  road has right of way over the other.</li><br>
			<li>Since an output pattern to the lights is necessary
			  to remain in a state, we solved this system with a
			  Moore FSM.</li><br>
			<li>It had two inputs (car sensors on North and East
			  roads) and six outputs (one for each light in the
			  traffic signal.)</li><br>
			<li>The six traffic lights were interfaced to Port B
			  bits 5–0, and the two sensors are connected to Port
			  E bits 1–0:
			  <ul>
			    <li>PE1=0, PE0=0 means no cars exist on either
			      road</li><br>
			    <li>PE1=0, PE0=1 means there are cars on the East
			      road</li><br>
			    <li>PE1=1, PE0=0 means there are cars on the North
			      road</li><br>
			    <li>PE1=1, PE0=1 means there are cars on both
			      roads.</li><br>
			  </ul>
			</li><br>
			<li>The next step in designing the FSM was to create
			  some states.</li><br>
			<li>We created decision rules defining what to do for
			  each possible input and for each state.</li><br>
			<li>For this design we listed heuristics describing
			  how the traffic light was to operate:
			  <ul>
			    <li>If no cars are coming, stay in a green state,
			      but which one doesn’t matter.</li><br>
			    <li>To change from green to red, implement a
			      yellow light of exactly 5 seconds.</li><br>
			    <li>Green lights will last at least 30
			      seconds.</li><br>
			    <li>If cars are only coming in one direction, move
			      to and stay green in that direction.</li><br>
			    <li>If cars are coming in both directions, cycle
			      through all four states.</li><br>

			<li><strong>Vending Machine Finite State Machine
			    (FSM):</strong>
			  <br><a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_FSM_VendingMachine">Link to
			    embedded systems class files for the Vending Machine Finite State Machine</a><br>

			  <ul>
			    <li>This section uses a function
			      variable.</li><br>
			    <li>For example we defined function variables in this format:
			      "void (*functionPt)(void);"</li><br>
			    <li>The design goals were as follows: design a
			      vending machine with two outputs (soda, change)
			      and two inputs (dime, nickel).</li><br>
			    <li>Our Solution: This vending machine example
			      illustrates additional flexibility that we built
			      into our FSM implementations.</li><br>
			    <li>Rather than simple digital inputs, we created
			      an input function that returned the current
			      values of the inputs.</li><br>
			    <li>Similarly, rather than simple digital outputs,
			      we implemented general functions for each
			      state.</li><br>
			    <li>This approach provided an alternative
			      mechanism when the input and or output
			      operations become complex.</li><br>
			    <li>Our simple vending machine had two coin
			      sensors, one for dimes and one for
			      nickels.</li><br>
			    <li>When a coin fell through a slot in the front
			      of the machine, a light from the sensor reflected
			      off the coin and was recognized back at the
			      sensor.</li><br>
			    <li>An op amp created a digital high at the Port B
			      input whenever a coin was reflected.</li><br>
			    <li>So as the coin passes the sensor, a pulse (V2)
			      was created.</li><br>
			    <li>The two coin sensors were inputs to the
			      FSM.</li><br>
			    <li>If the digital input was high (1), that meant
			      there was a coin currently falling through the
			      slot.</li><br>
			    <li>When a coin was inserted into the machine, the
			      sensor went high, then low.</li><br>
			    <li>Because of the nature of the vending machines
			      we assumed there cannot be both a nickel and a
			      dime at the same time.</li><br>
			    <li>This meant that the FSM input could be 0, 1,
			      or 2.</li><br>
			    <li>To implement the soda and change dispensers,
			      we interfaced two solenoids to Port E.</li><br>
			    <li>If the software made PE0 high, waited 10ms,
			      and then made PE0 low, one soda was
			      dispensed.</li><br>
			    <li>If the software made PE1 high, waited 10ms,
			      and then made PE1 low, one nickel was
			      returned.</li><br>

			    embedded systems class example files for the Stepper Robot Finite State Machine</a><br>

			  <ul>
			    <li>A motor can be evaluated in terms of its
			      maximum speed (RPM), its torque (N-m), and the
			      efficiency in which it translates electrical
			      power into mechanical power.</li><br>
			    <li>Sometimes however, we wish to use a motor to
			      control the rotational position "(θ=motor shaft
			      angle)" rather than to control the rotational
			      speed "(ω=dθ/dt)".</li><br>
			    <li>Stepper motors are used in applications where
			      precise positioning is more important than high
			      RPM, high torque, or high efficiency.</li><br>
			    <li>Stepper motors are very popular for
			      microcontroller based embedded systems because
			      of their inherent digital interface.</li><br>
			    <li>In this design, the first button made it spin
			      one way, and the second button made it spin the
			      other way, and the third button made it step
			      just once.</li><br>
			    <li>If both of the first two buttons were pressed, 
			      it wiggled back and forth.</li><br>

			  <ul>
			    <li>This lab demonstrated how to design a Moore
			      FSM based on lecture examples to control a
			      traffic light.</li><br>
			    <li>The microcontroller had 3 input sensors, one
			      each indicating cars on the east to west and
			      north to south roads, and one for a
			      pedestrian.</li><br>
			    <li>There were 8 output LEDs, 3 each for the
			      traffic lights for the east to west and north to
			      south roads, and one each for the walk and don't
			      walk signals.</li><br>
			    <li>There were 9 states with each output wait time
			      0.5 seconds.</li><br>
			    <li>Cars were not allowed to crash, and when the
			      don't walk signal flashed on and off, the
			      pedestrian knew to hurry up and cross.</li><br>
			    <li>When don't walk did not flash pedestrians knew
			      not to cross.</li><br>
			    <li>Pedestrians were not allowed to cross when

			    <li>If all 3 sensors were on, an output pattern
			      was output to the LEDs for 20 seconds.</li><br>
			    <li>The system had input independence since each
			      state had 8 arrows to the next state, depending
			      on the input and current state.</li><br>
			    <li>A Moore machine was used since the LED output
			      pattern was based on what state you were

		  <h4><strong>Goal of course:</strong> to put together all
		    that we learned in an old fashioned video game from the
		    1970s and 1980s, Space Invaders, which was optional and I
		    did not do, but may do someday!  Here are some details
		    about that.</h4>
		<a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/EmbeddedSystems_Lab15_SpaceInvaders_FromOtherClassmatesForMeToEvaluate">Link to
		  embedded systems class files for final project that we were
		  given to evaluate.  Project was optional, so I evaluated
		  without putting all my labs together here.</a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> ARM based microcontroller
		      board (LaunchPad) and a simulator (from
		      professors).</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Game controller hardware</strong> involved was a slide
		      potentiometer, 2 switches, 2 LEDs, resistors to
		      interface to the switches and LEDs, and a mini
		      display.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Images</strong> of the space invaders, space ships, lasers,
		      bunkers, etc, were 2 dimensional arrays.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Microcontroller timers</strong> were used for periodic
		      interrupts.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>The DAC (Digital to Analog Converter)</strong> was used to make
		      sound.</li><br>
		    <li>Graphics were displayed on the mini display
		    LCD.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Programming involved:</strong> timers,
		      interrupt service routines, the Analog to Digital (ADC) 
		      Converter, and device drivers for the DAC and
		      LCD.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Professors provided some code:</strong>
		      interfacing the graphics to the mini display.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Game controller:</strong) 2 buttons, 2 LEDs
		    and a slide potentiometer which acts as a joystick tomove
		    yourself to be protected by a bunker from the space
		    invader missiles, or to move beyond the bunker to fire at
		    them.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Audio files:</strong> were provided and a DAC
		      was used for making sounds to a speaker or headphones 
		      connected by an audio jack.</li><br>
		    <li><strong>Main game engine:</strong> ran in an infinite
		      loop, interrupted by 2 interrupt service routines
		      (ISRs).  
		      <ul>
			<li><strong>SysTick ISR ran 30 times per second (30
			    Hz)</strong> and handled:
			  <ul>
			    <li>the player ship fires (button
			      presses)</li><br>
			    <li>the player ship being moved (slide
			      potentiometer ADC (analog to digital
			      input)</li><br>
			    <li>the sound made for a button press fire was
			      scheduled by SysTick ISR, so that when the other
			      faster ISR, Timer2A ISR runs, it could output
			      more quickly (11 kHz, runs 11,000 times per
			      second)</li><br>
			    <li>the explosion sound array to the speaker or
			    headphone.</li><br>
			  </ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Timer2A ISR</strong> this interrupt
			  service routine ran faster than SysTick ISR.  It ran
			  at 11,000 times per second (as opposed to 30 times
			  per second for SysTick ISR).  Timer2A ISR was 11KHz,
			  but SysTick ISR was 30Hz.</li><br>
		      </ul>
		    </li><br>
		  <li><strong>Graphics (space invader enemies, player ship,
		      etc):</strong>movements were put into a buffer, but the
		      main game engine outputed them to the LCD display, (was
		      time consuming).</li><br>
