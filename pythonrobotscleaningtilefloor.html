		  <br><h4>Python Project to Demonstrate Which Type of Python
		  Robot Can Most Efficiently Clean A Tiled Floor</h4><br>

		  <br><p><em><strong> Python Project to demonstrate how different python
			robots can more efficiently clean a graphic of a
			tiled floor</strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>We used a graphic of a tiled floor and various types
		      of Python made robots to demonstrate how best and
		      efficiently it could be cleaned by these.</li><br>
		    <li>We used Python library packages Matplotlib (Pylab) and
		      NumPy for this assignment.</li><br>
		    <li>In this assignment we coded a simulation to compare
		      how much time a group of Roomba like robots take to
		      clean a floor using 2 different strategies.</li><br>
		    <li>The robot starts out in a random position in the room
		      and with a random direction of motion.</li><br>
		    <li>A given floor had "N > 0" robots.  The room was
		      rectangular.  We had to keep track of which tiles of the
		      floor had already been cleaned by the robots.</li><br>
		    <li>Each robot had a position "(x,y)" in the room and a
		      direction of motion "(0 <= dir < 360)" degrees.</li><br>
		    <li>All robots moved at the same speed.  Every time step,
		      a robot moves in its direction by speed "s" units.  If a
		      robot detects it will hit a wall within the time step,
		      that time step is instead spent picking a new direction
		      at random.</li><br>
		    <li>We did not put all the robots methods in one class, 
		      since we also used alternate moving strategy robots that
		      used the same robot interface otherwise.</li><br>
		    <li>In each trial, the objective is to determine how many
		      time steps on average are needed before a fraction of
		      the room has been cleaned.</li><br>
		    <li>The professors provided us with some animation
		      software so we could more easy with visualizations debug
		      our code while our robots cleaned the room.  However, it 
		      slows down running your code.</li><br>
		    <li>We tried out robots that change direction only when
		      they hit walls, and other robots that randomly change
		      direction every time step.</li><br>
		    <li>Using Pylab, we plotted the percentage of room that a
		      robot cleans, time it takes 1-10 robots to clean 70% of
		      a room,  percentage of a room that 1-10 robots clean,
		      time for robots to clean varying percentages of a room, 
		      and area of a room that 1-10 robots clean, and similarly 
		      these statistics for various sized rooms.</li><br>
