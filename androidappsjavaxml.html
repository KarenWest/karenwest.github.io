		    used too), with either an ARM or Intel microprocessor
		    emulated device.</li>
		    <li>We used the Android Development Kit and Eclipse
		      programming tools to build introductory yet complete and useful 
		      apps during this course.</li>
		    <li>Fundamental computer science principles and
		      programming ideas that power today’s

		    <li>You hear the Beatles "Happy Birthday Song - Live
		      Version" playing in the background once the app opens, 
		      and only stops to send an email, or if you click the bottom image, of Peter with his saxophone.</li>
		    <li>If you click that image of Peter playing his saxphone,

		    <li>If you hit the ESC key, you come back to the app, and
		      the Beatles happy birthday song starts to play again.</li>
		    <li>I chose to make this because it happened to be my
		      eldest child's 11th birthday on Valentine's day 2014 during this class.</li>

		  <p><em><bold>How the Play With Music App works:</bold></em></p> 
		  <ul>
		    <li>This application simply "plays with music" using web views and separate activities.</li>
		    <li>There are 2 activities outside main, one that has buttons that take you to the You Tube video page for 
		      those musical songs.</li>
		    <li>The other activity uses a raw mp3, but also has buttons that start and stop the raw mp3 song.</li>
		    <li>The interactivity is the button presses that the user
		    must press, that are responded to in the Java code.</li>
		    <li>Unlike the first app in this assignment, I used the
		      "onClick" properties in the XML code to specify the Java
		      routine to respond to the button press, since I used
		      "listeners" in the onCreate code to respond to those in the first app.</li>
		    <li>The music I chose was really randomly chosen trying to
		      find music that may appeal to all sorts of people's tastes in the class who evaluated the apps.</li>
		    <li>For the raw musical section, I chose "Happy New Year",
		      since we just started a new year, and also, because this
		      version is a mix of opera and rock.</li>
		    <li>The app demonstrated interactivity.</li>

		  <ul>
		    <li>I decided to use 5 activities for this assignment,
		      using the first one just to direct the person running it
		      to go back to the main menu, to see the icons to run the
		      activities for JabberWocky, RoundBall, War of the Worlds
		      and Univ. of Illinois at NASA.</li>
		    <li>I also embedded the jabberwocky image as an IMG
		      element within the poem html page given by the professor.</li>
		    <li>It was challenging at first for me to get the buttons
		      for Jabberwocky to work correctly within the separate
		      XML layout using the web view defined in the main XML
		      file.</li>
		    <li>Rather than make the buttons respond to the onClick
		      property in the XML file, in my web search, I found
		      another way of doing that, by making a listener for the
		      button within the onCreate activity code.</li>
		    <li>I also searched and searched but could not find a
		      short enough mp3 clip for the jabberwocky poem, 
		      and finally found one as a phone ring, but it was not
		      that great, so instead, used a 30 second music 
		      clip I had laying around that has nothing to do with
		      that poem, called "Nutrocker", from Emerson, 
		      Lake and Palmer in the 1970's, since I had no other 30
		      second clip, and no time left to find one that 
		      would match better with the Jabberwocky poem!</li>
		    <li>I had no issues with the other activities,
		      incorporating the provided RoundBall game in one
		      activity, Univ. of Illinois at NASA's web page in
		      another activity, and War of the Worlds web page in 
		      another activity.</li>

		  <ul>
		    <li><p>Grace Murray Hopper (1906-1992):  Grace was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.  A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and developed the first compiler for a computer programming language.  She conceptualized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first modern programming languages. She is credited with the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches  (inspired by an actual moth removed from the computer).  The U.S. Navy named a ship after her and Cray named a supercomputer after her at NERSC.</p></li>
		    <li><p>Ada Lovelace (1815-1852, England): Ada's mathematical talents led her to an ongoing working relationship and friendship with British mathematician Charles Babbage, and in particular Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine.  She translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with a set of her notes, simply called Notes-- containing what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. She also developed a vision on the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others focused only on those capabilities.</p></li>

		  <p><em><bold>In this lab at the summit, we created an analog

			keeping the best practices for the platform in mind.
			There was a bonus section on using the Palette API to
			automatically choose the color of the watch
			face.</bold></em></p>

		  <p><em><bold>The lab was split in the following sections at

		  <h4>Purpose of the Android Wear Tutorial and Lab:</h4>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Android Wear is a wearable platform designed for small, powerful devices, worn on the body.</li>
		    <li>It is designed to deliver useful information when you
		      need it most, intelligent answers to spoken questions,
		      and tools to reach fitness goals.</li>
		    <li>Being a personal Device, style is a big part of it.</li>
		    <li>Aside from offering a choice of manufacturers,
		      customizable watch faces give users even more ways to 
		      express their personal style.</li>  
		    <li>That is what we created in this lab.</li>

		    <li>A Watch Face is essentially a native service that runs
		    in the background on an Android Wear device.</li>
		    <li>Within this service, there is an engine that renders each screen.</li>
		    <li>This can be thought of as an animator flipping through the pages of a book with cartoon drawings.</li>
		    <li>The watch face code we created filled each of these pages, making the watch face move.</li>
		    <li>In this lab, Android Studio with the Android Wear SDK
		      was used rather than Elclipse with the Android SDK that
		      I used in the smart phone Anroid Apps described above
		      from an online course.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h4>Overview of Key components Used and how we connected
		  Android Wear to an emulator and ran the app:</h4>
		  <ul>
		    <li>MyWatchFaceService.java – This is the watch face and it's engine, MyWatchFaceService.Engine.</li>
		    <li>Within the Engine class, we created 3 methods:</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>onCreate() – we initiated new classes, such as the
		      bitmap image object for the background, etc, run when
		      the Engine is first started</li>

		      <li>onSurfaceChanged() – This is the first time that we
			have the dimension of the screen.</li>  
		      <li>Armed with this new information, we can resize any
			screen element for drawing.  This code was run only
			once at the start.</li>
		      <li>onDraw() – This is the core of the lab that we did.
			It renders every frame on the watch face canvas.
			Since it runs on every frame, it had to be as fast as
			was possible, so no image resizing or object creations
			were done here.  This allows us to have a higher frame
			rate which results in smoother animations.  No intense
			computations should be done here.  Image loading and
			resizing was done in onCreate() and onSurfaceChanged()
			only for this reason.</li>
		      <li>res/drawable-nodpi/ - directory where image files
		      were placed.</li>
		      <li>We connected our Android Wear to an emulator, and hit the run button, which installs the app to run on the emulated Android Wear device (instead of a real device).  We selected “Do Not Launch Activity” followed by run, since Activity is a program that users launch, and watch faces run in the background automatically, so there is no activity to run.
After the app is installed, you do a long tap on the watch face or emulator
			and scroll across until you see a watch face labelled
			“Analog Watch Face”, and select it by tapping on
			it.</li>
