		  <br><h4>Description of Brainstorm idea NOT followed, real
		    world problems such as hunger, world peace, cars without
		    need for fuel, heat and air conditioning, energy
		    efficiency and affordability</h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>The next idea was in the "real world problems" space.
		      What about tackling solutions to world hunger, world
		      peace, better designs for cars so that we are less reliant
		      on fuel, how to heat and air condition our homes and
		      work environments such that it is both affordable and
		      efficient and not wasteful, and adjustable by
		      individuals, since we all enjoy different levels of
		      comfort of heat and cold, people doing analysis on both
		      sides of the debate about how government can pay for
		      healthcare verses those that believe the only solution
		      is with privite health care and competition rather than
		      government funding, what about the funds for education
		      syhstems and making them consistent across all worlds?
		      These are diverse areas of "real world problems", and 
		      perhaps the plans for this fall in the data analysis 
		      space, economies and budgets?  Given these topics are
		      quite hard to solve, we did not pursue them for our
		      class project!</li><br>
