		      Simulation of Patient Virus Population Dynamics And
		      Treatment Regimens  </a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>Simulations for drug and disease industries, 
			where you have a number of diseased cells, antibiotics,
		      resistances to antibiotics, and a percentage you need to 
		      achieve to remove the illness, and a calculation to
		      compare using and not using a drug for it</li><br>
		    
		    <li>A Stochastic Simulation of Patient Virus Population
		    Dynamics And Treatment Regimens: Exercises In
		    Python</li><br>

		    <li>In this assignment, we used Python and Pylab to design 
		      and implement a stochastic simulation of patient and 
		      virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about 
		      treatment regimens based on the simulation
		      results.</li><br>

		    <li>In biology class, you learn that traits of an organism 
		      are determined by its genetic code.</li><br>
		    
		    <li>When organisms reproduce, their offspring will inherit 
		      genetic information from their parent.</li><br>

		    <li>Their genetic info. will be modified due to mixing or 
		      mutations in the genome replication process, thus 
		      introducing diversity into a population.</li><br>

		    <li>Viruses are no exception.  Two characteristics of 
		      viruses make them particularly difficult to treat.  The 
		      first is that their replication mechanism often lacks 
		      the error checking mechanisms that are present in more 
		      complex organisms.  This speeds up the rate of mutation.
		      </li><br>

		    <li>Secondly, viruses replicate extremely quickly (orders 
		      of magnitude faster than humans): thus while we may be 
		      used to thinking of evolution as a process which occurs 
		      over long time scales, populations of viruses can 
		      undergo substantial evolutionary changes within a single 
		      patient over the course of treatment.</li><br>

		    <li>These 2 characteristics allow a virus population to 
		      acquire genetic resistance to therapy quickly.</li><br>

		    <li>In this problem set, we make use of simulations to 
		      explore the effect of drugs on the virus population and 
		      determine how best to address the treatment challenges 
		      in a simplified model.</li><br>
