">Links to Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Code and Secret Messages, 
		    along with Code to detect specific strings in other
		    strings using only indexing, slicing, concatenation with a
		    recursive function and no loops, and also, code to
		    emulate and old fashioned type writer, Exercises 
		    in Python</a><br>

		  <br><p><em><strong> Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption 
			Pythod Code: </strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Encryption is the process of obscuring
		    information to make it unreadable without special
		    knowledge.</li><br>
		    <li>Encryption lets you share information with
		    other trusted people, without fear of disclosure.</li><br>
		    <li>A cipher is an algorithm for performing 
		      encryption.</li><br>
		    <li>The original information is called plaintext.</li><br>
		    <li>After encryption, it is called ciphertext.</li><br>
		    <li>A cipher depends on a piece of information called a 
		      key.</li><br>
		    <li>The same plaintext encrypted with 2 different keys 
		      should have 2 different ciphertexts.</li><br>
		    <li>Without the key, it should be difficult to
		    decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable
		    plaintext.</li><br>
		    <li>Caesar Cipher's basic idea is to choose an integer key,
		    shift every letter of your message by the integer key.
		    "h" becomes "j" for integer 2, "e" becomes "g", etc,
		    shifting the letter 2 spots to the right.</li><br>
		    <li>For this cipher's simplicity, punctuation and other 
		      such letters and numbers were ignored, and upper case 
		      was mapped to upper case, lower case to lower
		      case.</li><br>
		    <li>We then took someone else's encrypted text, and had to 
		      find the shift key that would decrypt the text, by 
		      finding if all words were valid from the shift key 
		      chosen.</li><br>
		  </ul>
		  
		  <br><p><em><strong> String 
			reversal using only string operations: indexing,
			slicing, concatenation with a recursive function, not 
			using any loops: </strong></em></p><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>Next, we were asked to do string reversal using only 
		      string operations: indexing, slicing, concatenation with
		      a recursive function, not using any loops.</li><br>
		    <li>Next we had to write an Erician function, meaning if a 
		      word contained the letters "eric" in that order, but 
		      there could be other letters in between, as long as in 
		      that order.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <br><p><em><strong>Emulating an old 
		      fashioned type writer, in that when ever it is in the 
		      middle of a word, and reaches the desired line length, 
		      the internal bell rings, signifying to the typist that 
		      after finishing the current word, a newline must be 
		      inserted manually: </strong></em></p><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>The last part of this assignment was to emulate an old 
		      fashioned type writer, in that when ever it is in the 
		      middle of a word, and reaches the desired line length, 
		      the internal bell rings, signifying to the typist that 
		      after finishing the current word, a newline must be 
		      inserted manually.</li><br>
		    <li>This process was emulated such that a newline was 
		      inserted as required after each word that exceeded the 
		      desired line length, and this newline insert function 
		      had to be recursive.</li><br>
		  </ul>
