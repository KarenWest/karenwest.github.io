		<ul></ul>

		<p><strong>Git and Git Hub is presented first, followed by an
		introduction to Ruby on Rails.
		</strong></p><br>

		<p><em><strong>Topics From Git and Git Hub:</strong></em></p> 

		<ul>
		  <li>Effective use of version control is an important and
		    useful skill for any developer working on long-lived 
		    (or even medium-lived) projects, especially if more than
		    one developer is involved.</li><br>
		  
		  <li>This course that I took was built with input from
		    GitHub, and covers the basics of using version control by
		    focusing on a particular version control system called Git 
		    and a collaboration platform called GitHub.</li><br>

		  <li>Git is used by many tech companies and universities too,
		    and a public GitHub profile serves as a great portfolio
		    for any developer.</li><br> 

		  <li>You establish an efficient programming workflow that
		  allows you to:
		    <ul>
		      <li>Keep track of multiple versions of a file</li><br>
		      <li>Track bugs by reverting to previous working versions
		      of a file</li><br>
		      <li>Seamlessly collaborate with other developers on a
		      project</li><br>
		      <li>The use of tools like Git and GitHub is essential
			for collaborating with other developers.</li><br>
		    </ul>
		</ul>

		<p><em><strong>Topics</strong></em></p>

		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Navigating a Commit History:</strong>We learned
		    about a few different types of version control systems and 
		    discovered what makes Git a great version control system
		    for programmers.</li><br>

		  <li><strong>We also got practice using Git to view the
		      history of an existing project.</strong> We saw all the
		      versions that had been saved, checked out a previous
		      version, and compared two different versions.</li><br>

		  <li><strong>Creating and Modifying a Repository:</strong> We 
		    learned how to create a repository and save versions of
		    our projects.  We learned about the staging area,
		    committing our code, branching, and merging.</li><br>

		  <li><strong>Using GitHub to Collaborate:</strong> We
		    practiced using GitHub or other remote repositories to
		    share our changes with others and collaborate on
		    multi-developer projects. We learned how to make and
		    review a pull request on GitHub.</li><br>

		  <li><strong>At the end, we practiced by collaborating with
		      other students to write a create-your-own-adventure
		      story.  Project: Contributed to a Live Project:</strong>
		    We published a repository containing our reflections from
		    the course and submitted a pull request to a collaborative 
		    Create-Your-Own-Adventure story.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Fundamentals of software engineering using Agile
		    techniques to develop Software as a Service using Ruby on
		    Rails.</strong></li><br>

		  <li><strong>This course taught the fundamentals for engineering long
		    lasting software using highly productive Agile techniques
		    to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) using Ruby on
		    Rails.</strong></li><br>

		  <li><strong>We learned to understand the new challenges and
		    opportunities of SaaS versus shrink wrapped
		    software.</strong></li><br>

		  <li><strong>We learned to understand and apply fundamental
		    programming techniques to the design, development,
		    testing, and public cloud deployment of a simple SaaS 
		    application.</strong></li><br>

		  <li><strong>We used best-of-breed tools that supported modern
		    development techniques including behavior driven design, 
		    user stories, test-driven development, velocity, and pair 
		    programming.</strong></li><br>

		  <li><strong>We learned how modern programming language features like 
		    metaprogramming and reflection can improve productivity
		    and code maintainability.</strong></li><br>

		  <li><strong>REST methods for applications was covered, along with
		    HTML and CSS formatting of web page and database
		    entries.</strong></li><br>

		  <li><strong>Ruby Calisthenics (exercises to learn this
		  scripting language)</strong>:<br> 

		<a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/saas1hw1">Link
		  to Files from Ruby Calisthenics described below</a><br>
		<ul></ul>
		    <ul>
		      <li><strong>Palindromes and Word Count functions in
		      Ruby.</strong></li><br>
		      <li><strong>Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Ruby.</strong></li><br>
		      <li><strong>Anagrams in Ruby.</strong></li><br>
		      <li><strong>Basic object-oriented programming (OOP).</strong>  We made a
			dessert class with getters and setters for name and
			calories.  We also defined the healthy? and delicious?
			methods.  We made a class JellyBean that inherited
			from Dessert class, but redefined the delicious?
			method of Dessert to say that black licorice was not
			delicious.</li><br>
		      <li><strong>Advanced OOP, metaprogramming, open classes, and
			duck typing.</strong> We created a method
			attr_accessor_with_history that tracks every value the 
			attribute has ever seen.</li><br>
		      <li><strong>Advanced OOP, metaprogramming, open classes, and
			duck typing.</strong>  It was a currency converter.  We also
			rewrote the palindrome Ruby function done in problem
			one as a method within the foo class.</li><br>
		      <li><strong>The last part adapted the palindrome method to work
		      with enumerables.  It dealt with Ruby iterators, blocks
		      and yield by having us write a Cartesion Product
		      example.</strong>  The constructor accepts 2 list sequences.  We 
			defined the each instance method of CartesianProduct,
		      which yields the cartesion product of the 2 sequences
		      used in the class constructor.  The iterator each should
		      yield the values one at a time as 2 elements
		      arrays.</li><br>
		    </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li><strong>Introduction to Rails, the Ruby Framework for
		  Web Applications:</strong>
		    <ul>

		      <li><a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/saas1_homework2">Link
			to Homework 2 Files that modified the Rotton Potatoes app to do
			the following described steps (all the way to the next
			link).</a></li><br>

		      <li><strong>We added some movies to the database, and deployed
			the "RottenPotatoes" application (a play on the "Rotten Tomatoes"
			movie and TV reviews web site) that displays the "list
			of movies" in a web browser.</strong>  We put our files on a
			public Heroku web site that allowed us to deploy our
			browser client files there.  The server was written
			by the people that rant the class and could be run on
			your local machine for debug purposes.</li><br>

		      <li><strong>Our next task was on the RottenPotatoes “All Movies”
			page.  We had to make the column headings for “Movie
			Title” and “Release Date” for a movie to be clickable
			links.  Clicking one of them should cause the list to
			be reloaded but sorted in ascending order on that
			column.</strong>  When the listing page is redisplayed with 
			"sorting on a column" enabled, the column header that
			was selected for sorting should appear with a yellow
			background.  We did this by setting controller
			variables that are used to conditionally set the CSS
			class of the appropriate table heading to “hilite”,
			and pasting a simple CSS snippet given to us into 
			RottenPotatoes
			"app/assets/stylesheets/application.css"
			file.</li><br>

		      <li><strong>The current RottenPotatoes views use the
			Rails-provided “resourceful routes” helper
			“movies_path” to generate the correct URI for the
			movies index page.</strong>  Passing this helper
			method a hash of additional parameters, those
			parameters will be parsed by Rails and become
			available in the "params[]" hash. Next, functionality
			was added within RottenPotatoes that allowed the user
			to filter movies by MPAA rating such as "['G', 'PG',
			'PG-13', 'R']".  The filter was controlled by check
			boxes at the top of “All Movies” listing.  When the
			“Refresh”  button was pressed, the list of movies is 
			redisplayed showing only movies whose ratings were
			checked.</li><br>

		      <li><strong>Next we remembered the settings.  If the user
			selected any combination of column sorting and 
			"restrict by rating constraints", and then the user
			clicks to see the details of one of the movies, when
			she clicks “Back to the movie list” on detail page,
			the movie listing should “remember” the user's sorting
			and filtering settings from before.</strong>  “remembering” is
			done using the session hash.</li><br>

		      <li><a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/saas1hw3">Link
			to Files that were used for Homework 3 as described
			below in the Behavior Driven Design (BDD) homework.</a></li><br>
		      
		      <li><strong>Behavior Driven Design: We created
			user stories to describe a feature of a Saas
			application using the Cucumber tool to turn user
			stories into executable tests.</strong> The tests ran 
			against the Saas app.  We wrote Cucumber scenarios
			that test "the happy paths" of the previous
			Introduction to Rails assignment described above.  We
			used "declarative scenario steps" for adding movies.  
			The goal of Behavior Driven Design (BDD) is to express 
			behavioral tasks rather than low level operations.  
			The background step of the scenarios in this homework
			required that the movies database contain movies. It
			is not the goal of BDD to do this by writing scenarios
			that spell out every interaction required to add a
			movie, since adding new movies is not the scenario
			test goal.  The given steps of a user story specify
			the initial state of the system.  It does not matter 
			how the system got into that state.  For Part 1 of
			this assignment, we created a step definition that
			matched the step "Given the following movies exist" in 
			the background section of 
			sort_movie_list.feature_and_filter_movie_list.feature.  
			We then added our code to the movie_steps.rb step
			definition file.  In the Active Record, we added
			movies to the database, since creating new movies is
			not what the scenario is testing.  Success was defined
			when all Background steps for the scenarios in 
			filter_movie_list.feature and movie_list.feature were
			passing (green).  For Part 2 of this assignment, we
			added "Happy Paths" to filter movies, restrict the
			movies with "PG" and "R" ratings in the 
			filter_movie_list.feature.  It allowed us to use
			existing steps in the web_steps.rb to check and
			uncheck the appropriate boxes, submit the form, and
			check whether the correct movies appear, ignoring the 
			case where the movie has no ratings.  Part 3 of this 
			assignment was to add "Happy Paths" by sorting movies 
			by title and release date.   Scenarios in 
			sort_movie_list.feature involve sorting, so we needed
			the ability to have steps that test whether one movie 
			appears before another in the output listing.  We had
			to create a step definition that matched a step such
			as that.</li><br>
			
			<li><strong>The last topic covered in this course was Test Driven 
			Development (TDD).  Test-driven development (TDD) is a 
			  software development process that relies on the
			repetition of a very short development cycle:
			requirements are turned into very specific test cases,
			then the software is improved to pass the new tests,
			only. I did no assignment for this section.  </strong></li><br>

			<li>There was a part 2 to this class that I never had
		the chance to take, which is why currently I'm doing a
		tutorial on Code Academy that fills in the gaps missed in part
		2 of this course (and more, the full stack).  <strong>The part 2
		course created more sophisticated apps by adding relationships 
		between models in apps and by enhancing their apps with
		JavaScript. You also learn about what happens after the apps
		are deployed to real users, including how to monitor
		performance, identify and fix common performance problems, and
		avoid compromising customer data. They taught how to apply Agile
		techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code, a critical
		skill for professional programmers.</strong>  Other topics covered in
		part 2 of this course include: How to form, organize and
		manage small programming teams, Introduction to design
		patterns: what they are and how to recognize opportunities to
		apply them, Using Rails for more advanced features like
		third-party authentication and elegantly expressing design
		patterns that arise frequently in SaaS.</li><br>

			<li><strong>Topics covered in the current Code Academy Full
			Stack tutorial that I'm currently working on to fill in the gaps
			missed from part 2 of this Ruby on Rails course, plus
			a bit more are:</strong>
			  <ul>
			    <li>HTML and CSS (building a portfolio web site that
		    is now on my resume)</li><br>
			    <li>Sass (in future)</li><br>
			    <li>Javascript (in future)</li><br>
			    <li>jQuery (in future)</li><br>
			    <li>AngularJS1.X (in future)</li><br>
			    <li>Command Line (in future)</li><br>
			    <li>Ruby on Rails (in future, further depth)</li><br>
			    <li>Ruby on Rails Authentication (in
			      future)</li><br>
			    <li>Git (in future, further depth)</li><br>
