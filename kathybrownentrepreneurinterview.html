		  Word Entrepreneur Interview with Kathy Brown, Freelance
		  Software Consultant in Specific Database Application Environment</a><br>

		  <h4>Kathy Brown Consulting,  Providence,RI, USA:</h4>

		  <p>The next entrepreneur interview came from my cousin,
		  Kathy Brown, in the Providence,RI area.  Kathy described her
		  entrepreneur experience to me in the following manner.  She
		  is an independent, individual, freelance software
		  consultant specializing in a specific database application
		  environment, Filemaker Pro.  Her consultant work began in
		  1998 when her staff position at a local university came to
		  an end.  She now independently provides consulting and
		  training in a database application environment.  Kathy
		  received no government, philanthropic, anchor instution, or
		  intermediary institution donations for her start up
		  consulting business, but Kathy does provide her services for
		  local nonprofits as a volunteer herself.  Kathys biggest
		  challenge was staying current with hardware and software
		  versions because she works in this position on
		  parttime status.  The growth of her business was mostly
		  from word of mouth of completing projects for customers.
		  Most of Kathys clients are higher educational institutions
		  across the country.  Kathy measures her success regularly
		  according to the amount of consulting work she has been
		  contracted to do.</p>
