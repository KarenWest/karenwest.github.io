			such as Yahoo and Google to create triggers when

		      We built a Python program to monitor and filter news 
		      feeds over the internet. </a><br>

		  <br><p><em><strong> Python Project to Parse Web Pages Such 
      as Google or Yahoo: created triggers when certain phrases were found 
      within the web pages</strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>We built a program to monitor news feeds over the 
		      internet.</li><br>
		    <li>It filtered the news, alerting the user when it 
		      notices a news story that matches the user's
		      interests.</li><br>
		    <li>Python concepts: implemented classes and their 
		      attributes, understanding class methods, understanding 
		      inheritance, telling the difference between a class and 
		      an instance of that class, and utilizing libraries as 
		      black boxes.</li><br>
		    <li>The project purpose was as follows:  Many web sites 
		      have content that is updated on an unpredictable 
		      schedule.  News sites such as Google News, are a good 
		      example of this.  One tedious way to keep track of this 
		      changing content is to load a website up in your
		      browser, and periodically hit the refresh
		      button.</li><br>
		    <li>This process can be streamlined and automated by 
		      connecting to the web site's RSS feed, using an RSS feed 
		      reader instead of a web browser.</li><br>
		    <li>An RSS (Really Simple Syndication) reader will 
		      periodically collect and draw your attention to updated 
		      content.</li><br>
		    <li>An RSS feed consists of (periodically changing) data 
		      stored in an XML-format file residing on a web
		      server.</li><br>
		    <li>For this project we did not need to know XML or how to 
		      access these files over the network.  We used a special 
		      Python module to deal with these lower level
		      details.</li><br>
		    <li>The higher level details of the structure of the 
		      Google News RSS feed was our focus of this problem
		      set.</li><br>
		    <li>If we loaded the URL into a browser, we would see the 
		      browser's interpretation of the XML code generated by
		      the feed.</li><br>
		    <li>When you connect to Google News RSS feed, you receive 
		      a list of items.</li><br>
		    <li>Each entry in this list represents a single news
		      item.</li><br>
		    <li>In a Google News feed, every entry has the following 
		      fields: guid = globally unique identifier for this news 
		      story, title, subject, summary, link. </li><br>
		    <li>The goal was to create an application that aggregates 
		      several RSS feeds from various sources and can act on
		      all of them in the exact same way all in one
		      place.</li><br>
