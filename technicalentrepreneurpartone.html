		  <h4>Technical Entrepreneur, 2 courses, Parts 1 and 2:</h4>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/technicalEntrepreneurPart1">Link to
		Technical Entrepreneur Part 1, Fiction Recommender Project,
		and the Brainstorm of Ideas class files and Part 1 topics</a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>

		  <p><strong>Objective Part 1:</strong> fundamentals of
		    technical entrepreneurship, pioneered in Silicon Valley
		    and spreading across the world.</p><br>

		  <a href="Types+of+Entrepreneurs.jpg"><strong>Technical Entrepreneur
		  Types of People</strong></a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>


		  <h4>What We Learned:</h4>
		  <ul>
		    <li>We learned the process technical entrepreneurs use to
		    start companies.</li><br>
		    <li>It involved taking a technical idea and finding high
		    potential commercial support, gathering resources such as
		    talent and capital, figuring out how to sell and market
		    the idea, and manage rapid growth.</li><br>
		    <li><strong> It demonstrated the entrepreneurial mind set: <em>where
		    others see insurmountable problems, entrepreneurs look for
		    opportunities in technology and business
		    solutions.</em></strong></li><br>
		    <li><strong><em>The idea was that an entrepreneur's
		    perspective is an excellent way of thinking</em> in order to
		    tackle new opportunities in social entrepreneurship,
		    whether with governments or NGO
		    (non-government-organizations).</strong></li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <p><strong>Part 1 Overview: My team project was
		    with team leader Amber Chang, who came up with a <em>fiction 
		    recommender social web site.</em></strong>  We each provided
		    brainstorms of ideas, and my list of ideas was included
		    in the provided class files link, but Amber asked me to
		    join her team and I did, rather than pursue mine for
		    this part of the class.  I'll list mine below that we did
		    NOT pursue in this class project.  We were asked to
		    submit these and mine were from what I thought about
		    through life experience and conversations with others,
		    some are from what the internet search gave me, and some
		    just observations from being out and about.  We explored
		    Ambers idea for the class project, but I share mine with you
		    for fun.  These are what I had to submit before we did
		    pursue the fiction recommender for the class project.</p>

		  <ul>
		      <li>For this project, we tested
		      whether the start up we proposed was worth pursuing and if
		      customers would like and agree with the problem we were
		      solving.</li><br>
		      <li>This allowed us to articulate the process for taking this
		      idea and finding high potential commercial
		      application.</li><br>
		      <li>We learned to create and verify a plan for gathering
		      resources such as talent and capital as well as creating 
		      and verifying a business model for how to sell and
		      market the idea.</li><br>
		      <li>We learned to generalize the process
		      of the entrepreneur mind set of turning problems into 
		      opportunities that can be used in larger companies and
		      other settings.</li><br>
		      <li><strong><em>An evolutionary idea</em></strong> if
		      successful as a start up would be bought by a larger
		      company.</li><br>
		      <li><strong><em>A revolutionary idea</em></strong> if successful in
		      a start up would become the next big
		      company.</li><br>
