		  <h4>Hardware and Computing Technology Design of a Smart Phone using the Jade design tools that run in a browser</h4>
		<a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/computingTechnologyInSmartPhone">Link
		to The Compute Technology in Your Smart Phone class files</a><br>
		<ul></ul>

		<ul>
		  <li>This course explored the different layers of computing 
		    technology within your smartphone.</li><br>
		  <li>We began at the hardware level, covering digital logic 
		    beginning with transistors and moving up to finite state 
		    machines.</li><br>
		  <li>In the second part of the course, we built on this 
		    material and discussed how computers are organized and 
		    designed, including how the hardware and software
		    interact.</li><br>
		  <li>Finally, we learned the basics of programming.</li><br>
		  <li>Much of this was a review for me, but used a new tool,
		  and also was applied differently, since smart phone CPUs did
		  not exist at the time I learned these things.</li><br>
		  <li>The three parts of this course gave a broad coverage of 
		    the technology that enables your smartphone to
		    operate.</li><br>
		  <li>Then, we moved beyond operation into performance, 
		    exploring advanced methods to speed up computers, 
		    including pipelining, multithreading, and multicore 
		    processors.</li><br>
		  <li>Finally, the course closed with an overview of actual 
		    processors used in smartphones.</li><br>
		  <li>Assignments throughout the course were tailored to build 
		    your understanding and solve problems.</li><br>
		  <li>Hands on work was done using the Jade simulation tool 
		    that runs in your browser to design a small working 
		    computer that functions using the same basic computing 
		    principles as your smartphone.</li><br>
		  <li>Part of this course was a review for me, having done 
		    similar things to design CPUs in graduate school in the 
		    1990s with the Mentor Graphics tools.  In those days,
		    the designs I did went into further depth in were made up
		    of large teams of people doing individual parts that we
		    then integrated together, and tested with other lower
		    level tools as well.  This course was a review of those
		    days in a sense, but applied to the applications CPU
		    engine of a smart phone.</li><br>
		  <li>By the end of the course, we were able to:
		    <ul>
		      <li>Describe how a smartphone processor works.</li><br>
		      <li>Explain computer system design from binary 
			information to programming.</li><br>
		      <li>Design a small working computer.</li><br>
		      <li>Describe common techniques used to make computers 
			fast.</li><br>
		    </ul>
		    </li><br>
		  </ul>
