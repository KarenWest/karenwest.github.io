		  Word Entrepreneur Interview with Joan Hartel Cabral,
		  President and CEO of Vantel Pearls</a><br>

		  <h4>Joan Hartel Cabral,  Vantel Pearls, Easton,MA, USA:</h4>

		  <p>My last entrepreneur interview came from a friend of a
		  friend in my current home town of North Easton,MA,USA,
		  although I have never met her before.  Joan Hartel Cabral is
		  President and CEO of Vantel Pearls here, and Joan started
		  this jewelry business in 1990.  Her mission was and still is
		  “to inspire women to run their own business and to enjoy
		  authentic and abundant life.”  She had no government,
		  philanthropic, intermediate nor anchor institution
		  contributions and started her business by offering her
		  family and friends a "25%" return on their investment if they
		  contributed to her start up, and she got started with
		  "$30,000" investments and her own "$1000".  Joans challenges
		  were that in the beginning, she went without her own income
		  for a handful of years, and found she could not afford to do
		  fun things such as go out to dinner unless she scrutinized
		  the cost of what was on the menu.  After a handful of years
		  living this way, Joans Vantel Pearl business became
		  profitable.  Another challenge Joan found starting her own
		  pearl jewelry business in 1990 was that many founders of
		  companies and CEOs were men so it was not common for women
		  to start their own business.  After a handful of years ,
		  Joan found that her Vantel Pearl business was experiencing
		  exponential growth, mostly by word of mouth.  Joan hired
		  “pearl jewelry demonstrators” whom would go to peoples
		  houses to throw parties, where the person would invite
		  friends to see Joans pearl jewelry, and the demonstrator
		  would receive part of the profits of the party where they
		  were a demonstrator.  Joan said she had no background nor an
		  education in the pearl jewelry business and figured it out
		  as she went what it would take to be successful in this
		  business.</p>

		  <p>The support that helped Joan succeed was her belief in
		  herself, a conviction that she would do well eventually no
		  matter what hardships she faced in the beginning.  Joan said
		  she latched onto anything in her life that helped her
		  believe in herself to be successful.</p>

		  <p>Joans measure of success is certainly a financial
		  measure, where over the years she has experienced a
		  consistent profit every year, and that is her business
		  success.  Joans personal life measure of her success is her
		  serenity and work and life balance, since she has observed
		  that many people in the President and CEO position of a
		  company do not have this work and life balance that Joan
		  does.</p>

		  <p>The beneficiaries of Joans success are the demonstrators
		  of the Vantel Pearls, and some of her demonstrators have
		  been with her for over 15 years.  Joan and her demonstrators
		  believe in “intrinsic personal development”, which Joan
		  describes as an “understatement”, and they attend womens
		  leadership conferences and businesses to speak about their
		  success and share their “treasure gems” which are listed on
		  the Vantel Pearl web site (8 of those).  A few of those for
		  Joan are: “trusting your intuitions”, “your richest rewards
		  come from helping others”, and for Joan, she is not shy to
		  say that she believes “a power greater than herself provides
		  her best guidance”.  Joan and her demonstrators share their
		  “treasure gems” at the women leadership conferences and
		  businesses where they are invited to speak about their pearl
		  jewelry business success, to inspire other women, sharing
		  the panel with other successful women from all different
		  types of backgrounds that are different to theirs.</p>
