			<p id="name">UNDER CONSTRUCTION WEB SITE,
			  All links now work.  However, the web site is still
			  under construction, since while building it, I
			  learned how better to design it going forward.
			  Future Plans are to shorten web pages if they are 
			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do
			  that too.</p>

		  <br><h4>Description of Brainstorm idea NOT followed, the
		  problem of making great rock and roll bands and other
		  inspirational good music affordable and worthwhile again
		  for people with these talents to tour, uniting the world
		  once again, making everyone happy, as they used to more
		  commonly do with so much creativity and effort in my youth!
		  </h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>The next idea was about solving the problem of live
		      music band tours worth attending.  when I was a teen
		      ager through my 20s, the world revolved around the live 
		      concert scene, and it was very affordable.  There was no 
		      internet, and you often first heard it on the radio, or
		      at a record store or at the concert itself.  Today I
		      find that live concerts are no longer affordable, if you 
		      find one worth seeing, and you have to dig on the
		      internet to find new music that is worth listening to, 
		      and often those people do not tour, not like they used
		      to at one time in my life.  If we could find a way to
		      meet the same goals with todays technology, get the
		      really talented musicians to tour, inspire the youth to
		      be more creative in this space, and unite the 
		      world as they used to do, and make it readily accessible
		      rather than having to search for it, and finding ways to
		      make concerts worth seeing affordable, I believe it was
		      the key to uniting the world when I was young, so many
		      different types of people, united in the great music we
		      all went to see together, live, in concert, at an
		      affordable price.</li><br>
