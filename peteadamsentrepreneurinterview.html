		  Word Entrepreneur Interview with Pete Adams, CEO Noah
		  Precision and SOLX</a><br>

		  <h4>Pete Adams, of Noah Precision and SOLX, started by Pete
		  in San Jose,CA, but company division is located in
		  Boston,MA,USA:</h4>

		  <p>Pete Adams is my cousin Debbies husband in San Jose, CA,
		  and he started 2 businesses with others, “Noah Precision”,
		  an employee owned company (with a large fund as an investor)
		  that is a manufacturer of temperature control equipment to
		  the semiconductor industry.  Our customers include HP, AMD,
		  Samsung, Texas Instruments, Lam Research, Applied Materials
		  and similar such customers.  Our smallest customer has
		  annual revenues of "> $10,000,000,000", with "80%" of that
		  outside the USA.  Noah Precision includes a board of
		  directors with more than 100 combined years of experiences
		  in the semiconductor equipment industry.  To reach the
		  international market, they have distributors in more than 10
		  key countries. Each distributor has a relationship with our
		  key customers that date more than 10 years.  Most of the
		  distributors that represent our products were once buyers of
		  his products.  Petes other business he cofounded 12 years
		  ago in Boston (but while living in CA), a glaucoma surgery
		  company in the Boston area called SOLX whose goal is to
		  preserve vision for an aging population.  SOLX is a
		  pre-revenue company seeking FDA approval for a surgical
		  device for treatment of glaucoma.  The board of directors
		  for SOLX includes doctors with more than 50 years of
		  experience in the glaucoma treatment industry.</p>

		  <p>The government played no role in our start up or has
		  provided no specific resources to accelerate our growth.
		  However, the State government in many states has encouraged
		  energy savings and has made a large pool of funds available
		  to our customers who purchase energy efficient equipment.
		  Since our temperature control equipment uses "80%" LESS energy
		  that what we replace, there has been a large subsidy
		  available to our customers when they purchase our equipment.
		  Internationally, governments have also created large pools
		  of funds to reduce energy consumption.  These funds have
		  provided for significant growth for us. Boston University
		  hosted a competition for emerging businesses and SOLX was
		  awarded a seat in their incubator.  Boston University
		  provided SOLX with facilities and trained staff to
		  accelerate our growth.  Boston University served as an
		  “anchor institution” for SOLX.</p>
		  
		  <p>The biggest challenge for Noah Precision is to fund the
		    product development process that ensures their technology
		    is at the leading edge for the benefit of our customers.
		    This spending consumes over "18%" of total revenue and it
		    continues to grow annually.  The only way to stay relevant 
		    to customers in the semiconductor industry is to have the
		    best technology and this requires investment.  Choosing
		    the right technology to invest in is always challenging.
		    Their measure of performance is return on capital
		    employed (ROCE).  This is the only metric they care about.
		    As small business owners, we want a significant return on
		    our invested capital and ROCE is the best measure of 
		    performance for us.  At some point, Pete will retire and 
		    finding a successor organization that will become the next 
		    measure of success for them.</p>
