		  <p><em><strong>We used Python and a provided Pac Man game written in
		      Python with the goal of the Pac Man not bumping into
		      walls, or ghosts that would eat them, and to instead
		      find food that gave them points, as they got through
		      various mazes to reach their goal.  We learned

			Search and Planning: Solution Search applied to Pacman
			game:</a> We implemented
			breadth first search (BFS) using a FIFO data structure to
			explore graph paths, depth first search (DFS) using a stack
			data structure for exploring graph paths, uniform cost 
			search and a star search, using priority queues to
			explore graph paths and had to compare the results.  
			We ran the algorithms on different sized mazes for
			Pacman to explore and made cost comparisons.  We
			examined what a greedy search would have been like,
			and how some searches do better when you optimize the 
		      heuristics.

			Multi Agents Added To Pacman, Including Ghosts, and
			Using Minimax and Expectimax Search Design and Better
			Evaluation Functions:</a> We designed agents
			for the classic version of the Pacman game which was 
		        provided to us, including ghosts.  We implemented both 
		        minimax and expectimax search and tried out evaluation 
		      function design.

			Markov Decision Processes: policies, rewards and

			TD/Q Learning, Exploration and Approximation
			Reinforcement Learning Project:</a> We implemented
			Value Iteration and Q-learning, and tested our agents
			first on GridWorld and later to a simulated robot 
		        controller (Crawler) Pacman.  Reinforcement learning: 
		        an agent that takes actions on an environment, and the 
		        output state and reward from the action are passed
			back to the agent that took the action.  It is a
			Markov decision process, non-determininsitic.
