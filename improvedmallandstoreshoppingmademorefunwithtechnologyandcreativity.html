		  <br><h4>Description of Brainstorm idea NOT followed, 
		    Improved Mall and Store Shopping Experiences
		    Through Creativity and Technology, so more people shop in
		    store for social fun rather than more often online:	
		  </h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>I recently visited the malls over Christmas, and found
		      that the efficiency is down, there are less people
		      shopping and instead buying things online.  I think with
		      some effort, shopping could be more enjoyable if spruced
		      up with modern day technologies and efficiencies, so the 
		      experience is not frustrating where people are instead
		      opting out of shopping socially, and instead choose to
		      shop from the comfort of their computer or mobile device
		      to avoid the frustration.  If you make it really fun,
		      efficient, comfortable, more people who shop 
		      socially for fun instead of resorting to doing it all
		      online.  Budgeting would be an issue though, since in
		      person shopping is more expensive for vendors, and you
		      would have to be smart with your budget to get it back
		      to being competitive in this manner.</li><br>
