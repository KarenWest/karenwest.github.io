		  <h4>Technical Entrepreneur Part 2, the Passport Social
		    Website Geared Toward the Travel Industry</h4>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/technicalEntrepreneurPart2">Link to
		    Technical Entrepreneur Part 2, Passport Social Website Project,
		    For the Travel Industry, and the topics covered in Part 2</a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>
		  
		  <p><strong>Objective Part 2:</strong> Technical Entrepreneur
		    Part 2 further explored the fundamentals of technology
		    entrepreneurship.</p>

		  <a href="adayinthelifeofanentrepreneur.png"><strong>Taken
		  From: A Day in the Life of an Entrepreneur</strong></a><br>
		  <ul></ul><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>We learned the process technology entrepreneurs use to
		      take a validated idea to the larger market and scale
		      their startup.</li><br>
		    <li><em><strong>The class demonstrated the entrepreneurial
			  mindset: where others see insurmountable problems,
			  entrepreneurs look for opportunities in technology
			  and business solutions.</strong></em></li><br>
		    <li>An entrepreneurial perspective is also a way of
		      thinking in order to tackle new opportunities in social 
		      entrepreneurship, whether it is in government or NGOs
		      (non government organizations).</li><br>
		    <li>Part 2 of this class covers an opportunity execution
		      project (OEP), where you test the rest of the aspects of
		      the business model and figure out how to actually
		      commercialize the product or service.</li>
		    <li>In Part 2 of Technical Entrepreneur, my partner from
		      Part 1 with whom we did the Fiction Recommender Web
		      Site, did not participate in Part 2, so instead, I
		      joined the Pass Port Social Web Site Team, with Will
		      Bruner whom asked me to join his team and later a side 
		      venture start up in wearable computing, although I never 
		      did end up joining the real life venture he was
		      investigating at this time.</li><br>
		    <li>Opportunity Execution Project (OEP): The Passport
		      Social Website was similar in many ways to FaceBook,
		      except geared toward the travel industry, with different
		      levels of membership, where you could follow friends as
		      they traveled and be directed to a travel web site if you
		      were interested in a similar vacation.</li><br>
