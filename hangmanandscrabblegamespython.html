			  All links now work.  However, the web site is still
			  under construction, since while building it, I
			  learned how better to design it going forward.
			  Future Plans are to shorten web pages if they are 
			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do
			  that too. <br><strong>NOTE: LEFT HAND COLUMN

			  and learning in both technical areas and business 
			  humanities.<br><strong>NOTE: MAIN PAGE:</strong> Details 
			  Professional Work Experience, Formal Education (BS

		  <br><h4>Hang Man and Word Find Games Written in Python: 
		  Using Successive Approximation and Newton Raphson's
		  Methods:</h4><br>

		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/PythonProject_SuccessiveApprox_NewtonRaphson_Iteration_HangmanGame">Links
		  to files for the Hang
		  Man and Word Find Games in Python</a><br>

		  <br><p><em><strong> Successive Approximation: 
		  </strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>We used successive approximation to try to guess the 
		      answer to a problem and then check our guess.</li><br>
		    <li>If guess is wrong, keep improving it in small 
		      increments and checking it, until you determine the 
		      answer is good enough.</li><br>
		    <li>We also looked at Newton's Method, which uses 
		      successive approximation to to find the roots of a 
		      function.</li><br>
		    <li>Polynomials were represented as lists.</li><br>
		    <li>The index of the list was the power, and the value of 
		      the index to represent the coefficient.</li><br>
		    <li>We also had to compute the derivative of
		      polynomials.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <br><p><em><strong>Newton's Method (also known as
			Newton-Raphson Method)</strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Newton-Raphson is a successive approximation method 
		      for finding the roots of a function, or the values of x 
		      such that f(x) = 0.</li><br>
		    <li>(1) iteration zero - guess some x0.</li><br>
		    <li>(2) check to see if a root by calcuating f(x0) within 
		      some small epsilon of 0.</li><br>
		    <li>(3) If f(x0) not good enough, come up with better
		      guess of x1.  "x1 = x0 - f(x0) / (deriv. of
		      f(xo))"</li><br>
		    <li>(4) check to see if x1 close enough to a root.  If
		      not, make better guess x2 and check and so on.</li><br>
		    <li>For every x(n), that is not close enough to root, 
		      replace "x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x(n)) / (deriv. of f(x(n)))" 
		      and check.</li><br>
		    <li>Repeat until you have a value close enough to
		      root.</li><br>
		    <li>Polynomial functions were used for
		    simplicity.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <br><p><em><strong>Hang Man Game in Python</strong></em></p>
		  <br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The last part of this problem set was a hang man word
		      game.</li><br>
		    <li>The computer selected from a list of available words 
		      read in from a list file.</li><br>
		    <li>The player knows the number of letters at start of
		      game.</li><br>
		    <li>Player guesses one letter per round.</li><br>
		    <li>Player receives immediate feedback whether letter is 
		      in word.</li><br>
		    <li>Each round the game displays partially guessed word so 
		      far, as well as letters player has not used
		      yet.</li><br>
		    <li>Player is allowed 8 guesses.</li><br>
		    <li>Player loses a guess only when guessing
		      incorrectly.</li><br>
		    <li>Error message displayed if same letter guessed twice, 
		      but not counted.</li><br>
		    <li>Game ends when player either guesses word or runs out
		    of guesses.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <br><p><em><strong>Scrabble Game in Python: Rules of the Game</strong></em></p>
		  <br>
		  <a href="https://github.com/KarenWest/PythonProject_ScrabbleWordGame">Links
		  to files for the Scrabble Game in Python</a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>Player is dealt hand of n letters chosen at
		      random.</li><br>
		    <li>Player arranges hand into as many words as they want 
		      out of letters, using each letter at most once.</li><br>
		    <li>Some letters remain unused and are not
		      scored.</li><br>
		    <li>The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for 
		      each word formed.</li><br>
		    <li>The score for a word is the sum of the points for 
		      letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the 
		      word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the 
		      first word created.</li><br>
		    <li>Letters are scored as in Scrabble. A=1, B=3, C=3, D=2, 
		      E=1, and so on.</li><br>
		    <li>A dictionary was used (key,value pair entries) to 
		      associate letter to its value for this game.</li><br>
		    <li>A function was used to get the frequency of a letter 
		      in a word.</li><br>
		    <li>When given a string of letters as input, it returns a 
		      dictionary (key,value pairs) of a letter as key, and the 
		      value was the number of occurrences of that letter in 
		      the word.</li><br>
