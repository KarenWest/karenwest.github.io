		  <br><h4>Hang Man and Word Find Games Written in Python: 
		  Using Successive Approximation and Newton Raphson's
		  Methods:</h4><br>

		  Man and Word Find Games in Python</a><br>

		  <br><p><em><strong> Successive Approximation: 
		  </strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>We used successive approximation to try to guess the 
		      answer to a problem and then check our guess.</li><br>
		    <li>If guess is wrong, keep improving it in small 
		      increments and checking it, until you determine the 
		      answer is good enough.</li><br>
		    <li>We also looked at Newton's Method, which uses 
		      successive approximation to to find the roots of a 
		      function.</li><br>
		    <li>Polynomials were represented as lists.</li><br>
		    <li>The index of the list was the power, and the value of 
		      the index to represent the coefficient.</li><br>
		    <li>We also had to compute the derivative of
		      polynomials.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <br><p><em><strong>Newton's Method (also known as
			Newton-Raphson Method)</strong></em></p><br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Newton-Raphson is a successive approximation method 
		      for finding the roots of a function, or the values of x 
		      such that f(x) = 0.</li><br>
		    <li>(1) iteration zero - guess some x0.</li><br>
		    <li>(2) check to see if a root by calcuating f(x0) within 
		      some small epsilon of 0.</li><br>
		    <li>(3) If f(x0) not good enough, come up with better
		      guess of x1.  "x1 = x0 - f(x0) / (deriv. of
		      f(xo))"</li><br>
		    <li>(4) check to see if x1 close enough to a root.  If
		      not, make better guess x2 and check and so on.</li><br>
		    <li>For every x(n), that is not close enough to root, 
		      replace "x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x(n)) / (deriv. of f(x(n)))" 
		      and check.</li><br>
		    <li>Repeat until you have a value close enough to
		      root.</li><br>
		    <li>Polynomial functions were used for
		    simplicity.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <br><p><em><strong>Hang Man Game in Python</strong></em></p>
		  <br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The last part of this problem set was a hang man word
		      game.</li><br>
		    <li>The computer selected from a list of available words 
		      read in from a list file.</li><br>
		    <li>The player knows the number of letters at start of
		      game.</li><br>
		    <li>Player guesses one letter per round.</li><br>
		    <li>Player receives immediate feedback whether letter is 
		      in word.</li><br>
		    <li>Each round the game displays partially guessed word so 
		      far, as well as letters player has not used
		      yet.</li><br>
		    <li>Player is allowed 8 guesses.</li><br>
		    <li>Player loses a guess only when guessing
		      incorrectly.</li><br>
		    <li>Error message displayed if same letter guessed twice, 
		      but not counted.</li><br>
		    <li>Game ends when player either guesses word or runs out
		    of guesses.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  to files for the Scrabble Game in Python</a><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>Player is dealt hand of n letters chosen at
		      random.</li><br>
		    <li>Player arranges hand into as many words as they want 
		      out of letters, using each letter at most once.</li><br>
		    <li>Some letters remain unused and are not
		      scored.</li><br>
		    <li>The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for 
		      each word formed.</li><br>
		    <li>The score for a word is the sum of the points for 
		      letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the 
		      word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the 
		      first word created.</li><br>
		    <li>Letters are scored as in Scrabble. A=1, B=3, C=3, D=2, 
		      E=1, and so on.</li><br>
		    <li>A dictionary was used (key,value pair entries) to 
		      associate letter to its value for this game.</li><br>
		    <li>A function was used to get the frequency of a letter 
		      in a word.</li><br>
		    <li>When given a string of letters as input, it returns a 
		      dictionary (key,value pairs) of a letter as key, and the 
		      value was the number of occurrences of that letter in 
		      the word.</li><br>
