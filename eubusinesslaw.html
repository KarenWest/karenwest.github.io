		  <p><strong>Overview: Note that this course was taken in
		      2014, before Brexit.</strong> The European Union is one
		      of the world's largest and most important
		      economies. Those interested in doing business with the
		      EU member states must know the rules and the practice of
		      relevant laws. The course was designed to give students
		      the essentials of European Union Business Law.  This
		      introductory course provided students with the
		      fundamental tools they need in order to be able to do
		      business with the EU, whether they live in Europe or
		      elsewhere. Students gained an understanding of both the
		      practical and theoretical aspects of European business
		      law and how the EU's Internal Market operates in a
		      global context. The focus was on topics central to
		      business law and to economic analysis, such as free
		      movement law, competition law, environmental law, trade
		      law and state aids law. Students gained a general
		      understanding of the European Unionâ€™s legal system and
		      explore the basic constitutional foundations of the
		      European Union.  Students learned how to find and use EU
		      legal material.  Throughout the course, qualified
		      researchers with experience from working with the courts
		      and institutions of the European Union and in private
		      practice gave lectures.</p>
