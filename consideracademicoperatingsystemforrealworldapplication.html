		  <br><h4>Description of Brainstorm Idea NOT followed of an
			academic operating system for real world application</h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>I had asked if it would make sense to hypothetically
		    explore the market worth of a project my husband did with
		    his Ph.D. students, to see if it had any potential for a
		    start up environment.  I won't be specific about it since
		    the response was that it would NOT be a good idea to
		    explore.  Without many details, they have designed an
		    operating system that currently works on the latest Intel
		    X86 multi-core microprocessors, taking advantage of
		    virtualization and another design that does not.  It can
		    work on a desk top but also for the embedded market
		    including safety critical systems.</li><br>
		    <li>The reasons it would not be a good idea to explore the 
		      project my husband did in an academic environment with
		      his "Ph.D." students in this class are because:
		      <ul>
			<li>The girl from the discussion forum said you should
			  not explore projects that have real world start up
			  potential in a class setting where you do not know
			  the people very well.</li><br>
			<li>She said people may <strong>poach</strong> the
			  idea if it is worth pursuing.</li><br>
			<li>She said someone on the student research team may
			  think they are entitled to something, a portion of
			  the profits or a share in the company if it takes
			  off, either before or after the fact, and it can
			  lead to a law suit.</li><br>
			<li>She said while some people in the class are
			  experienced professionals, some are not, and she did
			  not recommend conducting research or testing a
			  business idea that I was serious about with
			  inexperienced professionals.</li><br>
			<li>She did say that the class is a GREAT resource for 
			  identifying talent and exploring this business idea
			  OUTSIDE the class room project I do, or to take what
			  I learn, so I can research this idea myself
			  afterward.</li><br>
			<li>So I did NOT pursue this idea, nor did I pursue
			the rest of the ideas that I brainstormed that follow
			here, and instead followed Amber Chang's lead to be on
			her team.</li><br>
