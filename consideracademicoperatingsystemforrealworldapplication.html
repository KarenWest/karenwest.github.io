			<p id="notice"><strong><br>UNDER CONSTRUCTION WEB SITE</strong>,
			  All links now work.  However, the web site is still
			  under construction, since while building it, I
			  learned how better to design it going forward.
			  Future Plans are to shorten web pages if they are 
			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do
			  that too. <br><strong>NOTE: LEFT HAND COLUMN
			  LINKS:</strong> Recent and on going online projects
			  and learning in both technical areas and business 
			  humanities.<br><strong>NOTE: MAIN PAGE:</strong> Details 
			  Professional Work Experience, Formal Education (BS
			  and MS) along with recent online learning summaries</p>

		  <br><h4>Description of Brainstorm Idea NOT followed of an
			academic operating system for real world application</h4><br>

		  <ul>
		    <li>I had asked if it would make sense to hypothetically
		    explore the market worth of a project my husband did with
		    his Ph.D. students, to see if it had any potential for a
		    start up environment.  I won't be specific about it since
		    the response was that it would NOT be a good idea to
		    explore.  Without many details, they have designed an
		    operating system that currently works on the latest Intel
		    X86 multi-core microprocessors, taking advantage of
		    virtualization and another design that does not.  It can
		    work on a desk top but also for the embedded market
		    including safety critical systems.</li><br>
		    <li>The reasons it would not be a good idea to explore the 
		      project my husband did in an academic environment with
		      his "Ph.D." students in this class are because:
		      <ul>
			<li>The girl from the discussion forum said you should
			  not explore projects that have real world start up
			  potential in a class setting where you do not know
			  the people very well.</li><br>
			<li>She said people may <strong>poach</strong> the
			  idea if it is worth pursuing.</li><br>
			<li>She said someone on the student research team may
			  think they are entitled to something, a portion of
			  the profits or a share in the company if it takes
			  off, either before or after the fact, and it can
			  lead to a law suit.</li><br>
			<li>She said while some people in the class are
			  experienced professionals, some are not, and she did
			  not recommend conducting research or testing a
			  business idea that I was serious about with
			  inexperienced professionals.</li><br>
			<li>She did say that the class is a GREAT resource for 
			  identifying talent and exploring this business idea
			  OUTSIDE the class room project I do, or to take what
			  I learn, so I can research this idea myself
			  afterward.</li><br>
			<li>So I did NOT pursue this idea, nor did I pursue
			the rest of the ideas that I brainstormed that follow
			here, and instead followed Amber Chang's lead to be on
			her team.</li><br>
		      </ul>
