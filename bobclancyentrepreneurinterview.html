		  Design Studio</h4><br>

		  Word Entrepreneur Interview with Bob Clancy Spiral Design Studio</a><br>

		  <h4>Bob Clancy,  Spiral Design Studio, Albany,NY, USA:</h4>

		  <p>The next entrepreneur I interviewed was Bob Clancy, from
		  my high school class in Albany,NY.  His company, Spiral
		  Design Studio is located there and he said he received his
		  inspiration from both Albany State and also his experience
		  in Junior Achievement where in high school he learned about
		  starting your own business.  Bob founded his company in
		  1989. </p>

		  <p>The mission and background of Spiral Design Studio is a
		  progressive, graphic communications firm whose basic mission
		  is:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>To develop original and creative design solutions on
		      behalf of its clients.</li><br>
		    <li>To excel in high end traditional
		      print and web based interactive media.</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <p>Spiral Design Studio is a full service graphic design and
		    marketing firm serving national and regional clients since
		    1989. The Spiral Design team expertly balances creativity
		    and innovation with marketing strategy, logic and
		    analysis. It is this center brained approach that helps
		    our clients to reach their corporate objectives through
		    marketing that is engaging and effective, tactical and
		    targeted, meaningful and memorable.</p>

		  <p>Spiral Design Studios services are:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Graphic Design</li><br>
		    <li>Website Development</li><br>
		    <li>Corporate Branding</li><br>
		  </ul>

		  <p>The New York State Small Business Development Center at
		  the University of Albany helped Bob initially in advising us
		  how to do their accounting and how to structure our
		  business.  He did not have any requirements based upon their
		  contribution. Their assistance service was free.  They
		  served as an “anchor institution.”  They had no Philanthropy
		  or Intermediary Institutions, but they did have support from
		  family members who helped with our initial financing for the
		  purchase of equipment.</p>

		  <p>One of the challenges they faced was that there were many
		  long term established design and marketing firms in their
		  marketplace.  When they started their company,
		  digitally based graphic design was in its infancy. We were
		  able to take advantage of this technology to rapidly grow
		  their business. This gave them a great advantage over other
		  designs firms who were still creating commercial art the
		  traditional way. Not only were they able to produce
		  camera ready art for one tenth of the cost, but they were able
		  to produce it rapidly.</p>

		  <p>They measure success by competing against themselves to
		  always improve what they are doing. Obviously, success can be
		  monetarily measured, but more so for them, it is important to
		  have client satisfaction for the return on their
		  investment. They have largely built their business upon
		  word of mouth referrals and currently have clients such as:
		  Citi Group, Activision, Sears, Zales, Sunoco, Best Buy, Home
		  Depot, Disney, among others.</p>
