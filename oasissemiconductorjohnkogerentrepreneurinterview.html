		  <br><h4>Oasis Semiconductor Entrepreneur Interview with CEO
		  John Koger, where I worked from 2002 to 2004</h4><br>

		  Word Entrepreneur Interview with John Koger, CEO of Oasis Semiconductor</a><br>

		  <h4>John Koger, formerly of Oasis Semiconductor,
		  Boston,MA,USA – the most detailed interview:</h4>

		  <p>The entrepreneur interview I am sharing is within my
		  local to Boston,MA,USA ecosystem, and I worked for his
		  company, Oasis Semiconductor, from 2002 to 2004, in
		  Waltham,MA.  In 1995, John Koger asked his colleague,
		  Brendan Mullally to be his graphics and image processing
		  chip designer at a new start up company.  John used to work
		  in Digital Equipment Corporations graphics chip design group
		  and had decided he wanted to form his own start up company.
		  Johns good friend since elementary school in Weston,MA, Will
		  Wrenn, was the initial financer of the start up, and
		  provided them "$300,000" to get started in 1995.  Although
		  you wear “many hats” at a small start up company, John took
		  on the initial role of marketing and sales, while Brendan
		  was the designer.  They had both worked together at DEC on
		  graphics multimedia chips in Hudson,MA.</p>

		  <p>Here was the idea behind their companys mission.  Many
		  companies at that time, such as ATI which is now part of
		  AMD, Tseng Labs (1980s), and others in the graphics chip
		  market had decided that their mission was to sell their
		  graphics chips to all companies.  At DEC, the philosophy had
		  been that they made their own chips and incorporated them
		  into their own products, but John had observed that there
		  was a new trend happening where the above mentioned graphics
		  chip companies were supplying many different companies who
		  made computers that used graphics chips.  Johns idea was to
		  make a graphics chip that supplied the office equipment
		  space as a focus.</p>

		  <p>Initially John made many trips across the Pacific to make
		  sure they were going in a direction that the office
		  equipment companies would be interested in, and companies
		  such as Konica Minoltaq, Panasonic, Rico, Sharp and Xerox
		  were all quite interested in buying his chip.  John had
		  presented to them that his company would be able to make the
		  chip for them at a much cheaper cost and a lower risk than
		  what they were currently paying, and later John also
		  included the software to go with the chip.  The software was
		  really rolled up in the price of the chip, since for
		  accounting purposes, it is much easier to track the number of
		  chips sold, and customers could take the software provided
		  with it, and make as many copies of it as they needed to
		  make, so it was not trackable.</p>

		  <p>The idea of the business was to take a vertical market, a
		  market such as he and Brendan worked in at DEC, a
		  proprietary market where the company made all the chips,
		  software, and boards for computers for themselves, and cut
		  across this vertical organization into a more horizontal
		  market.  For example, Dell Computer is more of a horizontal
		  market, in that they contracted chips, boards, and software
		  which allowed them to take advantage of the “economies of
		  scale”, and consequently their costs as a company were lower
		  than DECs.  So Johns idea was to be able to supply all
		  customers and companies interested in buying a graphics chip
		  in the office equipment market.  That was their mission.</p>

		  <p>In terms of support after the chips were sold to
		  customers, that was minimal, except for just after initial
		  sales and delivery to the customer.  They provided the chip
		  and eventually also the software to go with it.</p>

		  <p>In terms of Oasis Semiconductors ecosystem of resources,
		  initially it was a friends belief in his success that
		  invested in their start up, Will Wrenn.  There were also a
		  few angel investors as time went on, other people who made
		  personal investments and no venture capital firm funds were
		  needed at the time.  The angel investments had “fewer
		  strings attached” in that they are usually people who know
		  you quite well at your companys start up and believe you
		  will succeed with their investment.  After this type of
		  angel investment, venture capital may have made sense for
		  their company, but they did not end up seeking it, because
		  what happened was that there were office equipment market
		  companies showing an interest in their chip and gave Oasis a
		  "50%" payment in advance for their chip.  The reason they did
		  not also seek venture capital investment was because often
		  times, venture capitalists are not interested when a product
		  is already on the market with customers paying for the
		  product.  They had no philanthropic donations and no anchor
		  institution contributions.</p>

		  <p>The challenges that John initially faced with Oasis in
		  the beginning was that they were a company of 3 to 5 people
		  for several years.  In that type of small start up, the
		  challenge is convincing giant corporations like Sharp to
		  have confidence in them, because they were so small.  It
		  helped that they were a fab less company, and instead asked
		  companies such as Samsung, Agere (an old spin off from
		  "AT&T"), and UMC (United Microelectronic Corporation in
		  Taiwan) fabricate their chips for them.  The reason this was
		  helpful in building larger company confidence was because if
		  their start up disintegrated, the large companies, such as
		  Sharp, had a “license to buy directly from Samsung (or the
		  others)” in the event that the start up disappeared.  So
		  that gave the large company customers the confidence they
		  needed to buy the graphics chips from Oasis without worry of
		  the company going away.</p>

		  <p>Other challenges were the tradeoffs you make for the next
		  generation of graphics chips.  The sales team hears from the
		  customers a list of software and hardware features the
		  customer wants for their next generation product.  The
		  challenge is what is realistically doable within the
		  engineers schedules to incorporate these new features and
		  the cost to incorporate the new features in the new graphics
		  chip and software product definition.  The saying goes that
		  if you take any of the three tradeoffs (feature, schedule
		  and cost), if you take 2 of them and incorporate them, the
		  3rd tradeoff suffers.  Planning this successfully was an on
		  going challenge.</p>

		  <p>Oasis Semiconductors opportunities originally came by
		  making graphics chips without software for the copy machine
		  market of office equipment customers.  These customers had
		  other vendors where they bought other chips to do the other
		  functions that the office equipment sometimes do in an all
		  in one printer, scanner, copier, fax machine, and initially
		  they only bought the copy machine graphics chip from Oasis
		  Semiconductor.  Oasis then saw an opportunity to make a
		  multi function peripheral (MFP), which incorporated all the
		  printer, scanner, copier fax machine chip functions onto one
		  chip.  This was a big success for them, since it made the
		  cost of buying chips cheaper for their office equipment
		  customers and they only had to buy from Oasis, not 4
		  different chip vendors for each function.  This also made
		  their purchase of circuit boards cheaper, and the
		  manufacturing of the product cheaper as well.  For example,
		  the first HP low end ink jet printer cost them "$1000", but
		  within 4 years, the cost went down to "$99" for reasons such
		  as this.</p>

		  <p>The way that John measured the success of Oasis
		  Semiconductor was that he had a lot of fun making his start
		  up successful which is important in life, but as a bonus, he
		  was able to sell the company in 2005 for 70 million dollars
		  in cash (not stock).  They were planning an initial pubic
		  offering (IPO) as their exit event as a start up whose stock
		  could trade publicly, but just when that was going forward,
		  there was a glitch in sales, and a year later, SigmaTel, a
		  former Texas audio company, bought them with the idea that
		  they would incorporate their audio chip with Oasiss
		  graphics chip.  This made the first dozen people who started
		  Oasis instant millionaires.  John explained that each time
		  you double the company size, stock options halve.  Usually
		  you can estimate that when a company is bought, the first
		  round of employees (3 to 4 of them) will get "5 to 10%" of
		  that 70 million dollars, the next 5 people get about "5%", the
		  next 10 employees get about "1%", and the next 20 or so get a
		  half percent of the purchase price with their stock
		  options.</p>

		  <p>John then explained that they were funded by angel
		  investors, not venture capital.  If they had been funded by
		  venture capital firms, the salaries of the employees would
		  have been higher but they would have been given less stock
		  options, but the venture capital firm provides more money
		  for start up equipment.  With the angel funding Oasis
		  received, the salaries of their employees were lower, and
		  they had less for their start up equipment, but the
		  employees received more stock options that were worth
		  something when the company was bought.</p>

		  <p>To end this story about Oasis Semiconductor, it is no
		  longer owned by SigmaTel, the Texas audio company that had
		  bought them in 2005, when their Wall Street Bankers told
		  them they should invest in the graphics chip business of
		  Oasis to add to their audio chip business.  What happened
		  was that SigmaTel then lost their Apple ipod business 2
		  months after the purchase of Oasis, so they could no longer
		  go forward with their plans to create a synergy between
		  their audio chips with Oasiss graphics chips.  SigmaTel
		  went into panic mode and put all their effort into their
		  audio chips but the business collapsed and was sold to
		  Conexant who did not keep the collapsed audio chip business,
		  but they did keep Oasis as their graphics chip business,
		  since Oasis had proven they were profitable to them.</p>

		  <p>John said that the benefits to society from his Oasis
		    Semiconductor business was that the printer cost dropped,
		    helping every day people better afford all in one
		    printer, scanner, copier, fax machines.  John explained that
		    130 people were employed and working at Oasis
		    Semiconductor, and that each one of their graphics chip
		    and software office equipment customers each employed 
		    perhaps 100 to 1000 people, and their manufacturing 
		    clients each employed 5 to 10,000 people to manufacture 
		    their chips.  So the employment of people also benefited 
		    society.</p>
