			  Future Plans are to shorten web pages if they are 
			  long in description by creating links to other
			  short length web pages within them.  I will add to
			  it over time as well, and I am still learning more
			  about the web languages, so I may tweak it as I do

		  <br><h4>Entrepreneur Interview with Sherry Toedt Insurance Agency</h4><br>
		  <a href="SherryToedtEntrepreneurInterview.docx">Microsoft
		  Word Entrepreneur Interview with Sherry Toedt Insurance Agency</a><br>

		  <h4>Sherry Toedt Insurance Agency,  Albany,NY, USA:</h4>

		  <p>My next entrepreneur was once again from my home town of
		  Albany,NY.  Her name is Sherry F. Toedt who shared her
		  entrepreneur experience as a Certified Insurance Counselor
		  and Certified Risk Manager, and is now President of Toedt
		  Insurance Agency.</p>

		  <p>The mission of Sherrys Toedt Insurance Agency is
		  primarily to assist small to medium sized businesses with
		  their property and casualty insurance needs and risk
		  management, and to help individuals find the most
		  appropriate personal insurance coverage at the most
		  affordable price.  Risk management information, coverage
		  education and risk reduction is also offered to the personal
		  lines customer.  Products are all lines of property and
		  casualty insurance including bonds.  Services are loss
		  control, assistance with risk identification, risk analysis,
		  risk control and risk financing.  The services can be
		  related to safety training and awareness, contractual
		  reviews and risk transfer options, financing including
		  deductible plans and retroactive rating plans as well
		  prospective rating plans as financial tools to most
		  appropriately price the cost of risk for a commercial
		  client.</p>

		  <p>There was a small government role.  Prior to opening,
		  Sherry met with the Small Business Administration for a
		  review of her plans and as a result was able to obtain a
		  business loan that was SBA backed.  The loan required that
		  she also had my own entry equity and was used primarily for
		  operating capital while it got off the ground.  No
		  philanthropy was given.  No anchor institutions contributed
		  to Toedt Insurance Agency.  Sherry was not sure if this
		  qualifies for intermediary institution or not.  It is not
		  support in the free sense.  However, she did join SIAA
		  (Strategic Independent Agents Alliance) that cost money to
		  join but provides so much in return.  It mostly provides
		  access to insurance companies and the ability to earn profit
		  sharing with those companies.  Without such a membership an
		  agency would have to have millions of dollars in written
		  premium with a company in order to get an appointment or to
		  ever get profit sharing.  Another form of support Sherry
		  received was from the bank where she obtained her business
		  loan.  They referred customers to her for several years
		  until they sold to another bank that has their own insurance
		  division.  Their referrals were a nice extra but not
		  integral to the success of my agency.</p>

		  <p>The challenges that Sherry faced as an entrepreneur
		  include wearing all the hats: administrative, sales, service
		  and managerial at the start, and sometimes even now, it can
		  be very time consuming.  The biggest strategic challenge for
		  Sherry was generating new business, having the time for
		  marketing and keeping up with it as a means to new
		  continuing revenue growth.  The initial tradeoff she had in
		  starting my own company was the flexibility to work from her
		  home office and be available for her child during his school
		  years.</p>

		  <p>One of the best elements that insured Sherrys success
		  was the network of people she had met in her community
		  through volunteerism.  So many were very supportive when she
		  opened her business as they had had opportunities to work
		  with her in PTA, sports, athletic boards and came to know
		  her level commitment and integrity so there was a natural
		  trust already built and they were willing to bring me their
		  business.</p>

		  <p>Other supports that helped Sherry succeed were of course
		  her membership in SIAA (mentioned previously) and her
		  membership in the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of
		  NY as well as her membership and fellowship in the National
		  Alliance for Education and Research.  The type of support
		  they provide can be technical (advice on websites, website
		  referrals), sales seminars and tools and education.
		  Sherrys 30 years in insurance made her an expert and she is
		  all about education of the client.  Many of her referrals
		  come because her customers come to know her as one of the
		  very few agents that completely understand what she does and
		  care about it passionately and  how it impacts them as
		  customers.  She is their trusted insurance adviser.</p>
 
		  <p>Success for Sherry is making a reasonable living by doing
		  what she knows best and making a difference for my customer.
		  Insurance does not matter until it matters and each of her
		  customers is taught about their insurance coverage and how
		  to make the best decisions in regards to their
		  insurance. Sherrys favorite saying is: “Insurance is NOT a
		  commodity like a gallon of milk to be purchased at the
		  lowest possible price but rather a complex financial tool
		  that should be purchased based on need and understanding at
		  the best AVAILABLE price”.</p>

		  <p>The beneficiaries of Sherrys success aside from herself
		  and her family are her customers and the insurance companies
		  she represents.  The customers receive outstanding products
		  specifically tailored for their needs at very competitive
		  prices.  The insurance companies receive preunderwritten
		  accounts that have been provided risk reduction education
		  which results in profitable business for the company. When
		  the companies are profitable their shareholders benefit as
		  do their customers with competitive premiums.</p>
